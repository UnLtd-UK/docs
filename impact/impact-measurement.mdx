## 3. BVC Social Impact Validation Matrix

**Big Venture Challenge – Social Impact Validation Matrix**
The Big Venture Challenge is designed to explore the scaling of social impact by providing support, investment finance and selection activities designed to encourage and enable social ventures to grow. A key aspect of the verification is to ensure that the social impact produce at scale is validated as effective in creating the intended and advertised social outcomes.
The matrix creates the link between:
**Social ****Change** – a short description of the social change described in terms of the difference sought in an individual beneficiary. For example, improved patient outcome, improved life chances, reduced risk of offending or drug use, achieving employment or education or volunteering, etc. The more specific this description the better for the Validation process.
**Theory of Change** – description of the theory of how the change described will be achieved. The matrix records whether this has been defined and if so what it is. The Theory of Change may ultimately be successful or unsuccessful.
**Change Process** – the processes which will be implemented as a practical deployment of the Theory of Change. The matrix describes whether this has been defined and deployed.  The Process may be effective or ineffective.
**Measurement** – in two parts; measurement processes (again recording whether defined and deployed) and the reporting process. For the later the matrix records if defined, deployed and actually published. This should also detail which metrics are measured.
**Validation** – a critical element; this describes the evidence which proves that the Theory of Change, Change Process and Measurement actually produce the social change.  This evidence may be from the social venture’s own research, from independent evaluation or from the BVC evaluation. The body of evidence may include government endorsed statistics/probabilities (e.g. chances of a NEET becoming an offender) and academic research. The important result is that the independent reader should be able to satisfy themselves that social change has and is taking place.
**Beneficiaries** – description of the beneficiary and the number of individuals who have experienced the Change Process and who the Validation shows have experienced the Social Change.

# Measuring Your Social Impact 1: Impact Framework Design




This document will guide you through preparing your own simple social impact framework to measure and value the positive change your organisation creates.

By the end of this workbook, you should be able to:
- Articulate the problem you are trying to solve.
- Understand the purpose and the target audience for your impact assessment.
- Design a simple theory of change that explains how your organisation drives social impact.
- Find the critical data points you need to track the impact you are generating.
- Put together a clear data strategy to help you plan how you will gather and manage data.
## INTRODUCTION
### Why do we measure social impact?
“The social change that an organisation creates through its actions (i.e. the impact of its interventions).”
UnLtd 

We want to understand what benefits our activities are generating for our beneficiaries and how they are addressing a pressing social challenge. 
Social impact focuses on the change to the beneficiaries, such as the community, individuals and families:
- It has to be an actual change that would not have happened without your work.
- It is a significant change to a person/people/ community.
- It has to be a change that has some ‘staying power’; it lasts beyond the interaction.
Social impact can include improvements in personal wellbeing, household dynamics and other social change in the community. It can also be economic, environmental, political or related to health and health systems.
Quantifying social impact can help us:
Explain our work to various stakeholders, for instance when we are applying for funding
Make managerial decisions that can improve our operations. For example, we may want to change how we run a particular activity to make it generate a more positive impact on our beneficiaries or at a lower cost.
Inform our customers about our impact.








## STEP 1
### Defining the Problem
One of the first steps to understanding your social impact is identifying the problem you are solving, which directly feeds into your **problem statement **that you will often see in a business plan or a pitch to investors.
The aim is to think about what the real difference your solution will make.
The framework below helps to consider the problem from different perspectives. 
- Start by looking at the information about the problem and why it is significant. Be specific when describing the problem.
- Focus on who is the beneficiary and how they are affected by the problem. Adding descriptions and details such as demographics helps to refine the issue even further.
- Once you have established who the problem is for, you can look into what Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental factors affect the problem. Looking at the PESTLE factors enables a deeper understanding of the context and may influence the way you tackle the problem.
- To define the problem in detail, it is also essential to show evidence that this is a problem worth solving. Add relevant data points about the extent of the problem from external sources such as public research reports.
- The final step is to assess what alternatives your beneficiary currently has access to and what are their advantages & disadvantages.






## STEP 1
### Defining the Problem
#### TO-DO
Use the template below to determine the problem you are trying to solve.
## STEP 2
### Mapping Out the Key Stakeholders

Stakeholders are a person, a group of people or an organisation that has an interest or concern in the organisation.
The impact you want to communicate will not be relevant or interesting to all the stakeholders of your venture. Understanding the different types of stakeholders can help you target the right audience for impact reporting and ensure that the report contains relevant information and in the appropriate format. 
We have focused on stakeholders who are **external to the organisation **(so excluding employees, for example) and classified them into the following three categories:







## STEP 2
### Mapping Out the Key Stakeholders
#### TO-DO
- For each group of stakeholders below, list ones you can think of for your organisation.
- Once you have completed your list, pickone1 stakeholder per category and circle them, then answer these two questions for each one: What do they want to know? How will you inform them?
## STEP 3
### Design Your Impact Framework

Theory of Change is a visualisation tool to help you understand and map out what impact your organisation aims to achieve and how it can do it. 
It can be an internal document to help your organisation to shape strategy and operational decisions. It is also the crucial starting point for gathering impact data, preparing reports and other information for the relevant stakeholders. The framework is never truly finished: as work in progress, it is always helpful to update and refine it. 
Below is the Theory of Change pyramid that outlines the key elements.
## STEP 3
### Design Your Impact Framework
#### TO-DO
- You will need four sets of Post-It® Notes to make it easier for you to try out different ideas and move them around.
- Work through the pyramid below, answering the questions to write down each component of the Theory of Change on Post-It® Notes.
- Try to stick to the recommended number of Post-It® Notes, but if you have more, then you can then narrow down your ideas in the next exercise.
## STEP 3
### Design Your Impact Framework
Once you have all your Theory of Change stages written down, it’s crucial to sense-check that they clearly explain what your organisation is trying to achieve.
Here are the key things to look out for:
**Specific**** ****and**** clear****:** each point on your *Post-It®* Note must address a distinct stage and be easy to understand to people external to the organisation.
**Relevant****:** think back to STEP 2 when you mapped out your key stakeholders. Does your Theory of Change align with what they would be interested to learn?
**Logical****:** do all the stages link together? Is the causality clear?
#### TO-DO
Looking at the chain below, work your way from your Activities/Resources through to your Impact *Post-It® *notes. 
- Ensure that each stage of your Theory of Change is specific and relevant.
- Check the assumptions and arrange your Post-It® notes for each part of your impact framework so that they form a logical chain and link together.
- Once you have a structure that makes sense, write it down or take a picture to prepare your Theory of Change design. Take a look at Appendix 1 for some examples.


## STEP 4
### Select Your Key Performance Indicators

Once you have designed your Theory of Change, you can devise ways to measure the different stages that lead to your desired impact. The aim of this is two-fold:
- Measure what change you are achieving; and
- Understand how your work is generating this change.
Using your Theory of Change as a starting point, you can identify how each activity, output, outcome and impact can be measured. 








Methods and Tools
There are many different methods and tools available to measure your impact. We have grouped these into three main groups:
- Quantitative: This is data that you gather first-hand about your users. You can use tools such as surveys, forms, tracking user online user behaviour or events.
- Qualitative: this may be anecdotal evidence, stories and case studies. You can collect this data through conducting interviews or focus groups with your beneficiaries, or providing self-recording tools such as diaries or beneficiary photography to capture outcomes.
- Secondary: you can use data created outside of your organisation to estimate impact you may be generating. For example, using indices and demographic, economic and other social data about the sector or geography in which you operate.







It is useful to incorporate all three of these method types in your data collection so that you can triangulate and sense-check the results.










Measuring Your Work: 
Intensity and Delivery
When selecting key performance indicators to track your work, make sure to cover:
- The intensity of your work: how often you engage with your users and the resources required for your activities.
- Delivery of your work: how many users gain access to your activities and what is their feedback on the goods/services you provide?
Measuring Your Change: 
Breadth and Depth
When measuring the change from your work, think about data that captures: 
- The depth of change: the extent to which your work has made a difference. For example, you may think about how dramatically things have changed for a typical user.
- The breadth of change: how many users you have affected through the work that you do.
Checking Your KPIs
Specific and clear**:** the indicators are precise and easy to understand.
Relevant: think back to STEP 2 when you mapped out your key stakeholders. Do the indicators make sense to the people to who you are reporting?
Logical: the indicators illustrate your work and prove the changes you are claiming.
#### TO-DO
You will need some more *Post-It*® Notes for this exercise. Going back to your Theory of Change, think of at least one indicator to track each of your activities, outputs, outcomes and overall impact. Make sure your indicators: 
- include intensity, delivery, breadth and depth;
- are specific and definite, relevant and logical.
## STEP 5
### Data Collection Plan

Data collection plan is the strategy for what indicators you will try to track and how you will gather this data. 
**What** is the indicator you are looking to track? Make sure this is specific and clear.
**Why** are you tracking this indicator? Having a clear goal for each metric ensures you are not gathering data that is unnecessary or irrelevant. Specify the type of measurement this is (output, outcome or impact). 
**How** will you gather this data? This description would include the methodology, such as a particular type of survey or index and the tools you have to capture this data (online services, internal systems your organisation has in place). Think about the cost of collecting the data, for example, if it is an interview, then how many labour hours do you need to gather responses from all or a sample of your beneficiaries?
**When** will you need to measure this data and how frequently? For example, it is useful to measure behaviour outcomes three months after your service has finished, at most six months. Gathering the data too often may not show much development and will cost more for the organisation.
**Who** is responsible for gathering this data? Allocate data capture to individuals within the organisation. Make sure that you have included data collection in their job description and have allocated sufficient time and resources to the task to ensure it is fully integrated into your operations. 
**What is the purpose**** **of** **this data? For example, is it for a particular report to a funder or other stakeholders?
Thinking about targets
In addition to identifying performance indicators as part of your data collection strategy, it is also useful to set goals against these data points. These targets should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-limited.


## STEP 5

#### TO-DO
You can use the accompanying data collection template or design your own, that would fit better with your organisation’s systems and processes.
Looking back at the indicators from the previous exercise, you can start listing them in your data collection plan.



## STEP 6
### Social Impact Management Cycle
The Social Impact Management Cycle (SIM-C) is an approach to improve how you gather data and use this data to optimise how you generate impact. It consists of 3 stages:
- Design: sets out what you will measure
- Do: are the actions you will take to measure the impact you achieve.
- Learn & Adapt: is the hardest but most significant part of SIM-C. It relies on your leadership, organisational culture and ability to adapt your ways of working.
Here are some of the primary considerations when designing your SIM-C:
**Proportional:** You can scale this cycle to managing a large organisation or down to testing a single idea. The steps in the cycle need to operate at different scales. 
**Integrating:** combine each step for the stages with the core business activities.
**Have a reason:** do not start measuring impact until you know why you are doing it and what you will do with that data. There may be internal reasons, such as better aligning strategy and operations with impact. You may also need to measure impact due to an external factor, for example, if your funders require an update on how the organisation is performing.

## CONGRATULATIONS
You have now completed the first UnLtd Social Impact Workbook. We hope that you have been able to design your Theory of Change and prepare a Data Collection Plan to start measuring your social impact.
At the end of this module, you should have the following materials:

## APPENDIX
### Theory of Change Examples
When designing your Theory of Change, think about its purpose and audience. You may create more detailed diagrams to inform your team, and a more simplified one for external messaging, such as sharing your work with customers and other stakeholders. 
They can be structured horizontally, with activities leading to outcomes and impact. Alternatively, they can be vertical with the impact either at the top or at the base of the page.
Theory of Change should reflect the branding and values of your organisation, so it makes sense to your team not only in terms of content but also aesthetically.

Stakeholders are a person, a group of people or an organisation that has an interest or concern in the organisation.
The impact you want to communicate will not be relevant or interesting to all the stakeholders of your venture. Understanding the different types of stakeholders can help you target the right audience for impact reporting and ensure that the report contains relevant information and in the appropriate format. 
We have focused on stakeholders who are **external to the organisation **(so excluding employees, for example) and classified them into the following 3 categories:







## STEP 2
### Mapping Out the Key Stakeholders
#### TO-DO
- For each group of stakeholders below, list ones you can think of for your organisation.
- Once you have completed your list, pick 1 stakeholder per category and circle them. Then answer these two questions for each one: What do they want to know? How will you inform them?
## STEP 3
### Design Your Impact Framework

Theory of Change is a visualisation tool to help you understand and map out what impact your organisation aims to achieve and how it can do it. 
It can be an internal document to help your organisation to shape strategy and operational decisions. It is also the crucial starting point for gathering impact data, preparing reports and other information for the relevant stakeholders. The framework is never truly finished: as work in progress, it is always helpful to update and refine it. 
Below is the Theory of Change pyramid that outlines the key elements.
## STEP 3
### Design Your Impact Framework
#### TO-DO
- You will need 4 sets of Post-It® Notes to make it easier for you to try out different ideas and move them around.
- Work through the pyramid below, answering the questions to write down each component of the Theory of Change on Post-It® Notes.
- Try to stick to the recommended number of Post-It® Notes, but if you have more, then you can then narrow down your ideas in the next exercise.
## STEP 3
### Design Your Impact Framework
Once you have all your Theory of Change stages written down, it's crucial to sense-check that they clearly explain what your organisation is trying to achieve.
Here are the key things to look out for:
**Specific**** ****and**** clear****:** each point on your *Post-It®* Note must clearly address a distinct stage and be easy to understand to people external to the organisation.
**Relevant****:** think back to STEP 2 when you mapped out your key stakeholders who you report to. Does your Theory of Change align with what they would be interested to learn?
**Logical****:** do all the stages link together? Is the causality clear?
#### TO-DO
Looking at the chain below, work your way from your Activities/Resources through to your Impact *Post-It® *notes. 
- Ensure that each stage of your Theory of Change is specific and relevant.
- Check the assumptions and arrange your Post-It® notes for each part of your impact framework so that they form a logical chain and link together.
- Once you have a structure that makes sense, write it down or take a picture to prepare your own Theory of Change design. Take a look at Appendix 1 for some examples.


## STEP 4
### Select Your Key Performance Indicators

Once you have designed your Theory of Change, you can devise ways to measure the different stages that lead to your desired Impact. The aim of this is two-fold:
- Measure what change you are achieving; and
- Understand how your work is generating this change.
Using your Theory of Change as a starting point, you can identify how each activity, output, outcome and impact can be measured. 








Methods and Tools
There are many different methods and tools available to measure your impact. We have grouped these into 3 main groups:
- Quantitative: This is data that you gather first-hand about your users. You can use tools such as surveys, forms, tracking user online user behaviour or events.
- Qualitative: this may be anecdotal evidence, stories and case studies. You can collect this data through conducting interviews or focus-groups with your beneficiaries, or providing self-recording tools such as diaries or beneficiary photography to capture outcomes.
- Secondary: you can use data created outside of your organisation to estimate impact you may be generating. For example, using indices and demographic, economic and other social data about the sector or geography that you focus on.







It is useful to incorporate all three of these method types in your data collection so that you can triangulate and sense-check the results.










Measuring Your Work: 
Intensity and Delivery
When selecting key performance indicators to track your work, make sure to cover:
- Intensity of your work: how often you engage with your users and the resources required for your activities.
- Delivery of your work: how many users gain access to your activities and what is their feedback on the goods/services you provide?
Measuring Your Change: 
Breadth and Depth
When measuring change from your work, think about data that captures: 
- The depth of change: the extent to which your work has made a difference. For example, you may think about how dramatically things have changed for a typical user.
- The breadth of change: how many users you have affected through the work that you do.
Checking Your KPIs
Specific and clear**:** the indicators and specific and easy to understand.
Relevant: think back to STEP 2 when you mapped out your key stakeholders. Do the indicators make sense to the people you are reporting to?
Logical: the indicators illustrate your work and prove the changes you are claiming.


Real Change
It’s key to ensure that the change you are tracking is really as a result of the work your organisation does. 
**Deadweight:** this is a change that would have happened anyway without your intervention. The aim is to understand what additionality your work generates. 
You can use surveys to track before and after an activity and measure the difference. Alternatively, ask questions like this to clarify what would have happened without your intervention:
Imagine changes in your life if you had never made contact with us. How would the following have changed?
**Attribution:** reviewing whether the benefit generated was as a result of your work or other activities.
A simple way to track this is through user surveys, for instance asking to rank your service along other alternatives:
Below is a list of different services that might make a difference to you. Please indicate how important each of these things has been to you.
**Benefit Period:** how long the benefit of your work lasts for the beneficiary. Asking questions like the following at the end of the benefit period will ensure you are not claiming outcomes that occurred separately from your work.
To what extent do you think any of the changes (if any) are because of our work?
There are more survey question examples in .
#### TO-DO
You will need some more *Post-It*® Notes for this exercise. Going back to your Theory of Change, think of at least one indicator to track each of your activities, outputs, outcomes and overall impact. Make sure your indicators: 
- include intensity, delivery, breadth and depth;
- are specific and clear, relevant and logical; and
- take into account deadweight, attribution and the benefit period.
## STEP 5
### Data Collection Plan

Data collection plan is the strategy for what indicators you will try to track and how you will gather this data. 
**What** is the indicator you are looking to track? Make sure this is specific and clear.
**Why** are you tracking this indicator? Having a clear goal for each metric ensures you are not gathering data that is unnecessary or irrelevant. Specify the type of indicator this is (output, outcome or impact). 
**How** will you gather this data? This includes the methodology, such as a particular type of survey or index. It may also include the tools you have to capture this data (online services, internal systems your organisation has in place). Think about the cost of collecting the data, for example, if it is an interview, then how many labour hours do you need to collect responses from all or a sample of your beneficiaries?
**When** will you need to measure this data and how frequently? For example, it is useful to measure behaviour outcomes 3 months after your service has been delivered, at most 6 months. Gathering the data too frequently may not show much development and will cost more for the organisation.
**Who** is responsible for gathering this data? Allocate data capture to individuals within the organisation. Make sure that you have included data collection in their job description and have allocated sufficient time and resources to the task to ensure it is fully integrated into your operations. 
**What is the purpose**** **of** **this data? For example, is it for a particular report to a funder or other stakeholders.
Thinking about targets
In addition to identifying performance indicators as part of your data collection strategy, it is also useful to set goals against these data points. These targets should be: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-limited.


## STEP 5

#### TO-DO
You can download our data collection template or design your own, that would fit better with your organisation’s systems and processes.
Looking back at the indicators from the previous exercise, you can start listing them in your data collection plan.



## STEP 6
### Social Impact Management Cycle
The Social Impact Management Cycle (SIM-C) is an approach to improve how you gather data and use this data to optimise how you generate impact. It consists of 3 stages:
- Design: sets out what you will measure
- Do: are the actions you will take to measure the impact you achieve.
- Learn & Adapt: is the hardest but most significant part of SIM-C. It relies on your leadership, organisational culture and ability to adapt your ways of working.
Here are some of the main considerations when designing your SIM-C:
**Proportional:** This cycle can be scaled to managing a large organisation or all the way down to testing a single idea. The steps in the cycle need to operate at different scales. 
**Integrating:** each step within the stages need to be combined with the core business activities.
**Have a reason:** do not start measuring impact until you know why you are doing it and what you will do with that data. There may be internal reasons, such as better aligning strategy and operations with impact. You may also need to measure impact due to an external factor, for example, if your funders require an update on how the organisation is performing.

## APPENDIX 1
### Theory of Change Examples
When designing your Theory of Change, think about its purpose and audience. You may create more detailed diagrams to inform your team, and a more simplified one for external messaging, such as sharing your work with customers and other stakeholders. 
They can be structured horizontally, with activities leading to outcomes and impact. Alternatively, they can be vertical with impact either at the top or at the base of the page.
Theory of Change should reflect the branding and values of your organisation, so it makes sense to your team not only in terms of content but also aesthetically.
Example 1: *UnLtd* Theory of Change


Example 2: *Proper Job Theatre Co* Theory of Change

Example 3: *Community Souls* Theory of Change

Example 4: *Radiant Cleaners* Theory of Change

Example 5: *Redemption Roasters* Theory of Change


Example 6: Art Bridges Theory of Change

## APPENDIX 2
### Survey Question Examples
Questions to establish deadweight 
One approach is to conduct a survey before and after an activity to check whether the response has changed. 
Another way of doing this is to ask the same question retrospectively, for example:
*Q1: **At present, to what extent do you agree with the following statement: *
*I feel I am able to live independently and make choices about my life**:*
❏*Strongly **a**gree** *❏*Agree** *❏*Neither **a**gree nor disagree** *❏*Disagree** *❏ *Strongly **d**isagree*
*Q2: **Thinking back to before you made contact with our organisation, please select a response that best describes your experience: I felt I was able to live independently and make choices about my life**:*
❏*Strongly agree *❏*Agree *❏*Neither agree nor disagree*❏*Disagree *❏ *Strongly disagree*
Alternatively, you can ask hypothetically what would have happened had your intervention not occurred, for example:
Q3: Imagine changes in your life if you had never made contact with our organisation. 
How would the following have changed?
❏*Worsened significantly *❏Slightly worsened ❏*No change *❏Slightly improved ❏ *Significantly improved*
If you had never made contact with our organisation, how likely would you have been to find a job elsewhere during the same period of time?
❏*Worsened significantly *❏Slightly worsened ❏*No change *❏Slightly improved ❏ *Significantly improved*

Questions to establish attribution
One way to calculate this is to ask your beneficiary to attribute the benefit to different interventions or services that have helped them, from the most significant to the least. 
An alternative is to list these services in addition to your own in the survey, and ask the beneficiary to indicate how important each was for them. Adding percentage estimates for each level of intervention can make it easier to track over time. For instance:
Below is a list of different services that might make a difference to you. Please indicate how important each of these things has been to you.
*	**	**Not at all (0%) *|* A little (25%) *|* **Some (50%) *| *Quite a lot (75%) *| *A** lot** **(100%)*
* **[Service** 1**]*
* **[Service** 2**]*
* **[**Service 3**]*
*…*

Questions to establish the benefit period
You can use surveys to check whether some outcomes you are claiming are within the benefit period, i.e. the benefits of your intervention last long enough to cause this outcome. The way to do this is to time your survey towards the end of the benefit period you anticipate and include questions like the following to establish your contribution.
To what extent do you think any of the changes we’ve talked about (if any) are because of our work?
❏Not at all (0%) ❏A little (25%) ❏Some (50%) ❏Quite a lot (75%) ❏ A lot (100%)

## ToC advice from peer support call

- Does the beneficiary recognise this change?
- Does the SV recognise this change?
- Look at how they can measure it? Does it fit with existing processes and procedures?
- Does it fit and does it matter? If not, remove it
- What will it be used for?
- Funders – needs to look pretty and show what they are doing quickly
- Internally – it really matters to have a detailed version – can make it focus on not proving what they do but improving what they do
- Test it with external people that knows the audience either a sector person or researchers/consultants (e.g. Sasha)
- Top 3 (no more than 5) outcomes
- Copy what other similar companies are doing!
