Resources:

KPI examples:
 
- People unsubscribing from / clicking through on your newsletter
Tips
- Less a science more an art – but still useful to map out the customer journey to understand points you should be mindful of
- Might provide opportunities for upselling providing foundation of trust has been established
- “Don’t feed the beast” – the CRM system is there to help you, not dictate your life!
- It’s a 2-way relationship. You can also assess how attractive different customers along dimensions such as reliability/profitability, reputation, ease to work with, want to create a true partnership
- Think about what’s the strength of your relationship at the moment – and where you’d like it to be
- Like ToC, you can apply the same idea of ‘Input’ (eg leads) -> ‘Outcome’ (eg sales via referrals) metrics to CRM KPIs
