## Product Development from GLS

How do you assess products and what data they use to do this?
​
How do you continually assess products and judge/direct product development? 
​
it would be interesting to see what business models they see underpinning each type of product and how this effects it's overall success?

Realistic approach to product development for start ups

Approach for developing products

**Slide Notes**

- User Journey

Use draw.io to create these flowcharts.  Essential place to start when thinking about how your product will be utilised by an end user.

If this takes into account the end user, how does this interface with business practices? E.g. business efficiencies to create/run the business?

- Database fields

Chance to put field names etc into an excel doc to help options selections that a user could select.  Helps inform final design and function of the information/product flow before you get carried away with the final design and making it look nice

- Draft Designs

Create a draft design of PP that includes what the fields should look like and what they should include.  Be very clear and descriptive to designers and developers (so that they create something to spec and on cost)

- Design and branding guidelines

Get the branding, typeface, buttons, colours, icons, alerts etc across the whole platform.  Make sure every element of the product creation is “unified” so that if something needs to be changed in the future it can be replaced simply and en-mass rather than individually on each page

- UX/UI

User experience (UX) – how do customers feel about your product, it’s the logic flow of the product/website etc
User interface (UI) – pure design about creating a product that works well

Few businesses separate the two



- Development

Normally pay for developers etc. £25-£30 per hour.  Often best to go to Eastern Europe. 

- Testing and 8. Bug fixing

Includes test functions of the website, features, products etc and then work out ways of fixing it.  Got to try and find ways of breaking the site/product.  You need to go through test simulation and capture test results.  You should always try to do this across different platforms, devices etc

Often businesses don’t pay people to do this but should.  Testing scenarios and bug fixing should be a mixture of end users and experienced testers.  Potentially 10% of totally product development budget.



- Always copy good design elsewhere.  If you can trail integrations of external tools then integrate it until it becomes cost effective or unfit for purpose
- Site terms to check with internet based services: search terms, bounce rate, where they click, what browsers they are using, google analytics, google tag manager etc
- Hotjar is a really powerful tool to understand how someone is using your website.
- “Fold line” things need to be above the fold line
- Lots of VCs ask for access to the google analytics page
- Also a way of identifying your sales funnel
- 3-5% conversion rate on e-commerce sites
- How do you spend the minimum amount of money to inform how you spend money in the future on advertisements etc?  Key question!
- Normally 70-80% of users are on mobiles, but its 50/50 for PLL
- Stage 6 is the only highly technical stage and the one that everyone jumps too.  Try to get early stage SEs to focus on stages 1-5.
