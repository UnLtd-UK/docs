## OKR SETTING – INTRODUCTION ACTIVITY

**OKR SETTING – INTRODUCTION ACTIVITY**

If you are interested in setting OKRs please use the below worksheet as a way of starting your thinking on the topic.

**Objectives: **
*The objectives are what you want to accomplish.**  **Objectives are meant to significant, action orientated, concrete and inspiring.  Put another way they should speak to the ambition and “why” behind why you do what you do.*
*E.g.** “**Build a successful MVP**”*

Activity – List 1-3 objectives:

- Objective 1
- Objective 2
- Objective 3

**Key Results:**
*The key results are how you want to achieve the objective. **Key results should be “SMART” (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound).  *
*If you find SMART goals too **rigid** you might want to think another way about how to set a good goal:*
- Does it relate to purpose
- Does it show variation over time
- Does it help us learn, understand and improve
- Is it in the hands of the people doing the work so they can change the system
- How can it be used by leaders to act on the change we want to see

E.g. “**Key result: **We have 100 weekly active users
**Key result: **Achieve a NPS score above 40
Key result: Secure 5 paid customers”

**Activity** – List 1-5 key results for each of your objectives:

Objective 1: 
- Key result 1:
- Key result 2:
- Key result 3:
- Key result 4:
- Key result 5:

Objective 2: 
- Key result 1:
- Key result 2:
- Key result 3:
- Key result 4:
- Key result 5:

Objective 3: 
- Key result 1:
- Key result 2:
- Key result 3:
- Key result 4:
- Key result 5:
