## Work Style Questionnaire

# WORK STYLE QUESTIONNAIRE

# UNDERSTANDING OUR WORKSTYLES


A further way of looking at behaviour in individuals and groups is to consider the 5 workstyles that we all have.

Learnt early in life in response to the need to ‘get it right’ for our parents and other ‘role models’, to be OK in other words, they can be very useful to us now as adults in the way we work in teams and on our own.  However, they can be over done.  Each of us will have preferences among the five and these preferences are likely to show under pressure.

In extreme cases these preferences can be the source of stress at work, literally driven behaviour.

An awareness of ours and others driver behaviour can be very useful.   

The five styles are;

Hurry – Up 
Be Perfect
Please People
Try Hard
Be Strong

They are very graphic labels and each can be understood by adding the phrase “I’m OK as long as I…..”.

Each is underpinned by a myth from childhood such as in ***hurry-up*** where I am only OK as long as I do everything as fast as I can.  ***‘Hurry-u******ps’*** are likely to have been encouraged as children to finish and do things quickly – such as eat, wash and get dressed.  We may well have run everywhere, always crammed in lots of tasks and activities.  The result is that as adults we now do everything as fast as we can including things like driving.  Our behaviour is marked by impatience.  As such we can be poor listeners often interrupting or finishing others sentences.  We think quickly and are heavily goal oriented.  Oh, and we HATE queuing!

As you can see some of these behaviours are likely to be more useful than others depending upon our roles and responsibilities.

**WORKSTYLE QUESTIONNAIRE**

Complete the following questionnaire, marking how much you agree with each statement.

## Lencioni questionnaire - Team Assessment

**Team Assessment**
**Instructions**
Use the scale below to indicate how each statement applies to your team.  It is important to evaluate the statements honestly and without over thinking your answers.  
3 = Usually, 2 = Sometimes, 1 = Rarely


**Scoring**
Combine the scores for the proceeding statements as indicated below:

A score of 8 or 9 is a probable indication that the dysfunction is not a problem for your team.
A score of 6 or 7 indicates that the dysfunction could be a problem.
A score of 3 to 5 is probably an indication that the dysfunction needs to be addressed.

Regardless of your scores, it is important to keep in mind that every team needs constant work, because without it, even the best ones can deviate towards dysfunction.

## Sequencing States

Ian McDermott’s Sequencing States


A state is your way of being at any given moment.  It is an indication of the quality of how you are in the world.  It will continuously vary.  You will always be in some sort of state, though it is likely that you will not be consciously or continuously aware of what it is

We can distinguish between our states and give them labels.  They are just our way of describing a particular state – usually adjectives to describe their qualities:
Tired, energised, curious, still etc.


We can change our states, moving from one to another.  If we are conscious of it we can decide to do something to maintain or change it.  It is important to realise that we do have that control

**Your Baseline State**

Your baseline state refers to that state which feels familiar to you, in which you feel “at home”.  It is the state you spend the greater part of your time in – your underlying state.

It doesn’t have to be comfortable – it may be one of anxiety – not comfortable but just familiar


**Moving from state to state**

Whenever you wish to achieve an outcome, if there is a gap between where you are and where you want to be, the question arises:
What can you do to move from the Present State (PS) to the Desired State (DS?)
The answer to this is to reflect on the resources you need to make that shift – bringing the right resources to where they are needed:

**PS + R = DS**


**Sequencing States**

A process of moving people through a felt experience – “A sequence of states”



- Think about your Present State – where you are now

- Think about your Desired State – where you want to be

***Formula:  P******resent ******S******tate****** + Resources = Desired State***

***Look at the att******ached sequencing states ******framework below:***


- Present State – where you are now


- Desired State – where you want to be


- “Halfway House” – what will the halfway point look like?


- Mid-Point – what will halfway between Halfway House and DS look like?


- Midpoint – what will halfway between PS and Halfway House look like?
