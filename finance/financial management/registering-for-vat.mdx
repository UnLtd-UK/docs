## Introduction

Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax levied on the sales of goods and services. Traders are required to register for VAT when their "taxable turnover" exceeds the VAT registration threshold, which is a figure fixed (and usually raised) in the Chancellor's Budget.

The legislation covering VAT is complex and it is important to seek professional advice or contact HMRC for guidance to ensure compliance with current law.

## Which Businesses Must Register for VAT?

All goods and services liable for VAT are known as **taxable supplies**. Whether a trader must register depends on their total sales value of taxable supplies — their **taxable turnover**.

Some supplies are **exempt from VAT** and do not form part of taxable turnover. Exempt supplies are typically services and include:

- Some property transactions
- Financial services
- Education
- Insurance
- Health and welfare services

Traders are required to register for VAT when their taxable turnover exceeds the mandatory VAT registration threshold (**£85,000** for the tax year 2020/21).

Registration is required when:

- Taxable turnover in any **rolling 12-month period** exceeds the threshold, or
- The trader knows that taxable turnover is **likely to exceed the threshold during the next 30 days** (e.g. due to winning a large contract)

The term **taxable person** applies to sole traders, partnerships, limited companies, LLPs, clubs, associations, charities and trusts.

VAT registration is by **taxable person, not by business** — if a self-employed individual owns multiple businesses and their combined taxable turnover exceeds the threshold, they must register.

## Voluntary VAT Registration

It is possible to register voluntarily before reaching the mandatory threshold (unless all supplies are exempt). This is common where firms primarily supply other VAT-registered firms, because it enables input tax to be reclaimed from HMRC.

Registering at start-up also enables input tax on start-up expenses to be reclaimed.

## Calculating Taxable Turnover

When calculating taxable turnover, include:

- The total value of UK sales that are not VAT-exempt
- Goods bartered, part-exchanged or given as gifts
- The value of any business goods taken for personal use
- Building work over £100,000 that the firm did for itself

**Include** zero-rated items (0%) in the calculation. **Exclude** items that are exempt from VAT or supplied outside the UK.

### Current VAT Rates

| Rate | Percentage | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Standard | 20% | Most goods and services |
| Reduced | 5% | Domestic energy-saving products |
| Zero | 0% | Children's clothes, food (with exclusions), books |

## Issues to Be Aware of When Registering

- If taxable supplies are **zero-rated**, a trader can apply for exemption from registration — but this means they cannot recover input tax
- If a trader makes both taxable and exempt supplies, they may be **partly exempt** — input tax can only be reclaimed on inputs towards taxable supplies
- A trader **cannot register** if they only make exempt supplies
- HMRC may grant an **exception from registration** if taxable turnover only temporarily exceeds the threshold
- Traders are assessed for VAT liability from when their turnover exceeds the threshold, but **cannot charge VAT until issued with a VAT registration number** — so register as soon as you think it will be necessary
- **Fines** may be imposed for failing to register at the correct time, and traders will be liable for any VAT they should have charged in the interim

## How to Register for VAT

Most taxable persons (sole traders, partnerships, limited companies) can **register online** at www.gov.uk/vat-registration/how-to-register. This also creates a VAT online account (Government Gateway Account) for submitting VAT returns.

Some traders must apply **by post**, including those who:

- Intend to apply for a registration exception
- Import goods from another EU country
- Are joining the Agricultural Flat Rate VAT scheme

HMRC issues a VAT registration certificate with a VAT registration number, usually within **30 days** of receipt of the application.

The **effective registration date** is the date taxable turnover exceeded the threshold (or the date voluntary registration was requested). Traders must charge and account for VAT from this date onwards.

### Making Tax Digital (MTD)

From April 2019, most VAT-registered businesses with taxable turnover above the threshold must sign up for Making Tax Digital for VAT. Under MTD rules, VAT records and returns must be managed digitally using software that meets HMRC specifications.

## Cancelling a VAT Registration

A VAT registration must be cancelled if the trader is no longer eligible (e.g. ceases to make taxable supplies or ceases trading).

De-registration can also be applied for if taxable turnover falls below the **de-registration threshold** (£83,000 for 2020/21 — slightly lower than the registration threshold).

**Key points:**

- Apply online through the VAT online account, or by post using form VAT 7
- Applications must be made **within 30 days** of the reason arising, or a penalty may be imposed
- A **final VAT return** must be filed to account for stock and other assets held up to the de-registration date

## VAT Inspections

HMRC has the power to carry out VAT inspections to:

- Examine business records
- Inspect business premises
- Assess underpaid tax and charge penalties

The frequency depends on the size and complexity of the business and its track record with VAT returns. HMRC must give **seven days' notice** before visiting premises, unless an unannounced visit is deemed necessary.

## Hints and Tips

- Keep up to date with VAT rule changes — HMRC provides videos, webinars, online courses and email updates
- The mandatory registration and de-registration thresholds are usually raised every year in the Chancellor's Budget
- Check taxable turnover regularly to ensure it doesn't unexpectedly exceed the threshold — register as soon as you think it will be necessary to avoid penalties
