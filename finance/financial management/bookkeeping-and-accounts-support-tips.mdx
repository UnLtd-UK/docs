## Sources of Support: General

A great source of support in this area are the regional LEPs (Learning and Enterprise Partnerships), which work between the commercial, voluntary and social enterprise space and support regional business development. Each area operates a little differently, so take a look at what's available locally.

- The Brighton and Hove local authority has a helpful page including info about the Coast to Capital Growth Hub and the Business and IP Centre Sussex
- The UK government's guide to company accounts includes lots of information, including obligations for CICs

## Accountancy and Bookkeeping Firms

The following firms are either social enterprises themselves, or provide specifically for social businesses. These have mostly come recommended by other award winners. Reach out to at least three providers so you have ample comparables in terms of both services offered and cost.

- **Social Enterprise UK** — management accounting, financial director support, general bookkeeping, accounting and management accounts. Free one-hour consultation.
- **Green Accountancy** — also recommended, believed to offer a free one-hour consultancy.
- **Social Enterprise Accounts CIC** — a smaller, Plymouth-based outfit worth exploring for those nearby.
- **Social Enterprise Accountancy Scotland CIC** — recommended for those in Scotland (contact: sheila@seas-cic.com).
- **Accounting for Good CIC** and **Harris Accountancy** — also worth considering.

## Back to Basics: General Hints and Tips

### Recording Your Finances

- If you haven't maintained business accounts before, the **Start Up Loans company** provides a free template. The Cash Flow Forecast supports financial forecasting and comes with a user guide. Note the Personal Survival Budget tab to help explore what salary you need to pay yourself.
- **Microsoft Office / Excel** is a common go-to for keeping finances. If you have an online Outlook/Hotmail account, a version of Excel comes free in OneDrive. Gmail offers Google Sheets (also free).
- For more advanced financial reporting, consider online accounting services like **Xero** or **QuickBooks** (monthly subscription, most have free trials).

### Delegating to Professionals

If you prefer to delegate this work (and can budget for it), you can bring on a chartered accountant or a bookkeeper:

- **Chartered Accountants** are registered with a professional body, have undertaken a minimum of three years of training and passed financial management exams.
- **Bookkeepers** specialise in recording financial transactions. Qualified bookkeepers can be found at the International Association of Bookkeepers and the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers. You'll still need an accountant at year-end for statutory accounts, but a bookkeeper may reduce set-up costs.

### Choosing an Accountant

- Check qualifications — look for ACA/FCA (CA in Scotland), ACCA/FCCA, or ACMA/FCMA
- Members of approved bodies must keep their technical knowledge up to date through continuing professional development
- Look for experience in your sector and/or working with startups
- Meet more than one firm before deciding — look for qualifications, experience, and empathy
- Check whether the first consultation is free

## Quick Reminders

- **Sole traders:** register for self-assessment with HMRC and set up a separate business bank account
- **Limited companies:** file annual accounts with Companies House and a tax return with HMRC for corporation tax
- **Filing tax returns yourself:** allow plenty of time — the UK government website will guide you through
- **VAT threshold:** if turnover exceeds £85,000, you may be required to register for VAT
