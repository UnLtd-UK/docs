## Introduction

A sales invoice is a document given by a business to a customer, setting out key information such as the goods or services being provided, the payment amount, payment terms and how to pay.

## Information to Include on Sales Invoices

### Recommended Information

- **Payment terms** — e.g. "Payment within 30 days"
- **How to pay the invoice** — accepted payment methods (electronic bank transfer, credit card, PayPal) and bank account details
- **Purchase order number** — if the customer is another business and has provided one

### Required Information

All sales invoices must include:

- The amount being charged for each of the goods and services listed
- The VAT amount (if applicable)
- The total amount payable
- The name and address of the business (for sole traders: their own name and any business name; for limited companies: the full company name as on the certificate of incorporation)
- The name and address of the customer
- A clear description of the goods or services being charged for
- The date the goods or services were supplied
- The invoice date (the date the invoice was generated — may differ from the supply date)
- A unique identification number (invoice number)

## VAT Invoices

If both the business and its customer are VAT-registered, additional information must be provided on the invoice, including:

- The business's VAT number
- The VAT rate applicable to the goods or services supplied
- The amount of VAT charged at each VAT rate

## Purposes of Issuing Sales Invoices

- **Ensuring payment** — prompts customers to pay and provides them with all the information needed to make the payment
- **Tax compliance** — an effective invoicing process helps businesses keep legally required tax records
- **Inventory management** — helps track incoming orders and establish whether sufficient stock is available

## Invoicing Software

Although invoices can be created using Excel or Word templates, many small businesses use specialist invoicing software. Benefits include:

- Automatic generation and delivery of invoices
- Tracking which payments have been made
- Sending automatic reminders
- Managing late and missing payments

Invoicing software is often included as part of a broader accounting software package and is also available from payment service providers and digital banks.
