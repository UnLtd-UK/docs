## Why Cash Flow Matters More Than Profit

A social venture can be profitable on paper and still run out of cash. This happens when the timing of money coming in doesn't match the timing of money going out — a grant is approved but won't arrive for three months, while rent and salaries are due this week.

Cash flow is the lifeblood of your organisation. Understanding it comes down to three things:

- **Income** — know what customers and funders owe you and get that money in as quickly as possible
- **Expenditure** — keep up with what you owe others (landlords, suppliers, employees) and pay on time. Don't commit to costs you can't cover.
- **Visibility** — know when shortfalls are coming and take steps to fix them before they become a crisis

If you only track one financial metric, make it your cash position.

## Building a Cash Flow Forecast

A cash flow forecast maps out your expected income and expenditure month by month, showing you when cash will be tight and when you'll have breathing room.

### Income Assumptions

Start by listing every income source and when you realistically expect the money to arrive (not when it's earned or invoiced):

| Source | Example Assumption |
|--------|-------------------|
| Grants | £20k grant expected in August — not yet applied for |
| Sales | Selling 20 items a month, increasing in 5s over the period; December increase due to Christmas; quieter Aug–Oct |
| Contracts | CCG contract income starting October — £10k over 3 years |
| Other | Workshop fees, membership subscriptions, donations |

Be honest about assumptions. Flag whether grants are applied for, approved, or just hoped for. Your forecast is only useful if it reflects reality.

### Expenditure Categories to Track

Use consistent categories so you can compare month to month:

| Category |
|----------|
| Salaries |
| Freelance and contractor costs |
| Rent |
| Professional fees (accountant, solicitor) |
| Telephones and IT |
| Office costs |
| Motor and travel |
| Materials |
| Subscriptions and training |
| Insurance |
| Marketing and PR |

### Reading Your Forecast

The key rows at the bottom of your forecast tell the story:

- **Total Income** — sum of all income for the month
- **Total Expenditure** — sum of all costs for the month
- **Surplus or Deficit** — income minus expenditure for that month
- **Balance brought forward** — your closing cash from the previous month
- **Closing balance** — your cash position at month-end

A negative closing balance means you're projected to run out of cash. Spot this early and you have time to act — chase outstanding invoices, delay non-essential spending, or draw down a grant earlier.

## The UnLtd Cash Flow Template

UnLtd provides a free cash flow template designed for social ventures. It includes:

- **Sales assumptions sheet** — document how you've arrived at your income figures, pricing, and the status of grants and loans (applied, not applied, approved)
- **Current year forecast** — 12 months of income and expenditure with running balances
- **Next year forecast** — the same structure, with an additional Marketing and PR category
- **Completion checklist** — ensures you've filled in every section before submitting

The template comes with a visual guide sheet explaining how to complete each section. It's a solid starting point if you haven't built a forecast before.

## Budgeting Essentials

A budget is your financial plan for the year. It sets out how much you expect to earn and spend, and gives you something to measure actual performance against.

**Building your budget:**

- Start with your income — be conservative. Only include income you're confident about. Use a separate "best case" scenario for hoped-for grants.
- List all costs, including ones that are easy to forget: insurance renewals, software subscriptions, Companies House filing fees, employer NI.
- Build in a contingency — at least 5–10% of your total costs for unexpected expenses.

**Reviewing your budget:**

- Compare actual figures against your budget monthly or at least quarterly
- Investigate significant variances — why did marketing cost twice as much as planned? Why is contract income 30% below forecast?
- Update your forecast when reality diverges from the plan

Good budgeting isn't about predicting the future perfectly. It's about having a framework that helps you make better decisions when things change.

## Maintaining Healthy Reserves

Reserves are your financial safety net — cash you keep aside to cover unexpected costs or income gaps.

**How much is enough?** Aim for at least **two months' worth of operating costs** in reserve. This gives you enough runway to weather a delayed grant payment, a lost contract, or an unexpected expense without immediately hitting a cash crisis.

**Income diversification matters.** If you rely on a single large contract or funder, you're vulnerable. As a rule of thumb:

- Have **10 or more clients or income sources** where feasible
- Watch out if **any single contract makes up more than 50% of your income** — losing it could be existential
- Diversify between earned income (trading), grants, and contracts

Building reserves takes time, especially for early-stage social ventures. Even setting aside a small amount each month starts to build a buffer.

## Understanding Your Debt Coverage Ratio

If your social venture has taken on a loan or social investment, your **debt coverage ratio** tells you whether you're generating enough income to cover repayments.

The formula:

> **Debt Coverage Ratio = Projected Operating Income (EBITDA) ÷ Future Debt Repayments**

- A ratio **above 1.15** means you're generating enough to comfortably cover your repayments with some headroom
- A ratio **below 1.0** means your income doesn't cover your debt — you're heading for trouble

Calculate this quarterly. If your ratio is falling, take action early: look at reducing costs, increasing income, or talking to your lender about restructuring.

**EBITDA** stands for Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation — essentially your operating profit before accounting adjustments. Your accountant can help you calculate it if you're unsure.
