## Why Good Invoicing Matters

A well-structured invoice does three things for your social venture:

- **Gets you paid** — it gives customers everything they need to process your payment quickly
- **Keeps you compliant** — proper invoices are a legal requirement and form part of the tax records HMRC expects you to maintain
- **Helps you track income** — numbered invoices make it straightforward to see what's outstanding, what's been paid, and what to chase

## What Every Invoice Must Include

All sales invoices must contain the following:

- Your **business name and address** (for sole traders: your own name and any trading name; for limited companies: the full registered company name)
- The **customer's name and address**
- A **unique invoice number** — sequential numbering is the simplest approach
- The **invoice date** (when you created it)
- The **supply date** (when goods or services were provided — may differ from the invoice date)
- A **clear description** of the goods or services being charged for
- The **amount for each item** and the **total payable**
- **Payment terms** — for example, "Payment within 30 days"
- **How to pay** — accepted methods (bank transfer, card, PayPal) and your bank details
- A **purchase order number**, if the customer has provided one (common with larger organisations and local authorities)

## Additional Requirements for VAT Invoices

If you're VAT-registered, your invoices must also show:

- Your **VAT registration number**
- The **VAT rate** applied to each item
- The **VAT amount** charged at each rate
- The **total excluding VAT** and the **total including VAT**

## Getting Paid on Time

Issuing a good invoice is only half the job. You also need to make sure the money actually arrives.

### Set Clear Payment Terms

State your payment terms on every invoice. Common options:

- **14 days** — suitable for smaller, regular clients
- **30 days** — the standard for most business-to-business work
- **Payment on receipt** — for one-off or first-time clients

Whatever terms you set, be explicit about them from the start — ideally in your contract or proposal, before you begin the work.

### Don't Let Customers Delay

Chase promptly when payments are overdue. A friendly reminder the day after the due date is far more effective than waiting three weeks. Most accounting software can send automated reminders, which removes the awkwardness.

If a customer consistently pays late, consider requiring payment upfront for future work or shortening their terms.

### Managing Public Sector Payment Cycles

If your social venture contracts with local authorities, NHS trusts, or other public bodies, be prepared for longer payment cycles — often **30 to 60 days** from invoice. Some tips:

- **Ask about their payment schedule** before you start work, so you can plan your cash flow around it
- **Submit invoices on their preferred cycle** — many public bodies batch payments monthly, so timing your invoice right can shave weeks off the wait
- **Use drawdown requests** for grant-funded work — these are often processed differently from standard invoices and may have their own timelines
- **Build these delays into your cash flow forecast** (see [Cash Flow and Budgeting](/finance/financial management/07-cash-flow-and-budgeting))

### Incentivise Early Payment

Offering a small discount for early payment — for example, 2% off if paid within 7 days — can accelerate cash flow. This works best with commercial clients who have the flexibility to prioritise your invoice.

## Invoicing Software

While you can create invoices using a Word or Excel template, specialist software saves time and reduces errors:

- **Xero**, **QuickBooks**, and **FreeAgent** — full accounting packages that include invoicing, automated reminders, and bank reconciliation
- **Square** and **SumUp** — payment providers that also generate invoices, useful if you take card payments in person
- **Zoho Invoice** — a standalone invoicing tool with a free tier for small businesses

If you're already using accounting software, use its built-in invoicing rather than a separate tool. This keeps everything connected — your income, VAT, and bank records all update automatically when you raise or mark an invoice as paid.
