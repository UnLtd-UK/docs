## Introduction

VAT (Value Added Tax) is a tax levied on the sales of goods and services. It is charged by traders who are registered for VAT, and is one of the Treasury's major sources of tax revenue. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) is responsible for ensuring that VAT-registered traders comply with the legislation relating to VAT and meet their responsibilities with regard to accounting for and paying the tax due.

The legislation covering VAT is complex and it is important to seek professional advice or contact HMRC for guidance to ensure compliance with current law.

## What is VAT?

VAT is a tax on spending that applies to the value that is added to a product or service at each stage of its production and distribution.

- VAT-registered traders must add VAT at the appropriate rate to the net sale price of any VAT-liable goods or services that they supply, and pay it to HMRC. Some types of supplies are exempt from VAT.
- VAT-registered traders can reclaim the VAT they have paid on goods and services that they have purchased for use in their business. Non-registered traders can neither charge nor reclaim VAT.
- Although VAT is collected in stages by VAT-registered traders, it is the consumer who ultimately pays the full amount of the tax.

VAT-registered traders are required to keep accurate records of all VAT transactions and complete and submit a summary of these to HMRC in the form of a VAT return at the end of each VAT accounting period (usually every quarter). Any VAT owed must usually be paid when the VAT return is submitted, although the exact date it is due depends on the method of payment.

From April 2019, most VAT-registered businesses with taxable turnover above the VAT registration threshold must keep their VAT records and submit their VAT returns digitally, using software that meets HMRC specifications.

There are specialist VAT schemes that traders can apply to join, which affect the way in which they collect and pay VAT and the dates on which it is due.

## The Principles of VAT

The principles of VAT that relate to traders are:

- Goods or services are purchased from suppliers at a price that includes VAT (the **input tax**).
- All goods or services that are liable to have VAT added to them at the appropriate rate (i.e. any goods that are not exempt from VAT) are known as **taxable supplies** and are sold to customers at a price including VAT (the **output tax**).
- Traders are required to register for VAT when the value of their sales of taxable supplies (known as their **taxable turnover**) exceeds the VAT registration threshold, which is a figure that is fixed (and usually rises) in the Chancellor's Budget each spring. Exempt supplies are not included in taxable turnover.
- Traders account for the VAT due to HMRC by completing and filing a VAT return at the end of their VAT accounting period. To calculate the amount of VAT that is due, the input tax paid to suppliers is deducted from the output tax received from customers and the difference is paid over to HMRC, or a refund is claimed if the input tax exceeds the output tax.

## VAT Rates and Exemptions

VAT must be charged at specific rates that vary according to the type of goods or services supplied. In some circumstances applicable rates of VAT also vary according to the user of the goods (for example children or people with disabilities), or to the type of trader or organisation providing the goods and services, such as builders or charities.

### Standard Rate (20%)

Covers all taxable supplies that are not reduced- or zero-rated and applies to most goods and services that are supplied in the UK.

### Reduced Rate (5%)

Charged on certain specific products and services, including:

- Domestic fuel and power
- Domestic energy-saving products
- Renovation and conversion of certain buildings
- Children's car seats
- Some healthcare products

### Zero Rate (0%)

Applies to specific categories of goods including:

- Children's clothes
- Food (exclusions apply including restaurant meals and catering supplies)
- Books and newspapers

The advantage of goods being zero-rated (as opposed to exempt) is that they are still included in the taxable turnover, so the input tax can be recovered.

If a product consists of both zero-rated and standard-rated goods (for example, food in a decorative container), there may be occasions when VAT will be charged at a proportional rate. HMRC has special schemes to help retailers selling a mixture of standard- and zero-rated products.

### Exempt Supplies

Exempt supplies are excluded from taxable turnover, meaning that input tax cannot be recovered. They typically relate to services rather than goods and are commonly found in the following sectors:

- Financial services
- Education
- Insurance
- Health and welfare services
- Some property transactions

It is important to clarify whether services supplied are exempt from VAT or not, and professional advice can be obtained from an accountant or from HMRC.

## VAT Thresholds and Registering for VAT

Traders are required to register for VAT and charge VAT on the goods and services they sell when their taxable turnover exceeds the mandatory VAT registration threshold (£85,000 for the tax year 2020/21).

VAT registration is required when the taxable turnover in any 12-month rolling period exceeds the current registration threshold or is likely to exceed it during the next 30 days (for example due to winning a large contract).

Once their taxable turnover exceeds the VAT registration threshold, the trader becomes a **taxable person** and is legally required to register for VAT.

The term "taxable person" applies not only to individual sole traders but also to partnerships and separate legal entities such as limited companies, limited liability partnerships, clubs, associations, charities and trusts.

**Key points:**

- VAT registration is by taxable person not by business — if a self-employed individual owns more than one business and together these exceed the threshold, they must register for VAT.
- It is possible to register voluntarily for VAT before taxable turnover reaches the mandatory threshold. This is common where firms will primarily supply other VAT-registered firms, and also enables input tax on start-up expenses to be reclaimed.
- Fines may be imposed by HMRC if traders fail to register at the correct time, and traders will also be liable for any VAT that they should have charged in the interim.

### De-registration

A trader can apply to de-register for VAT if their taxable turnover falls below the de-registration threshold (£83,000 for the tax year 2020/21), or if they cease to make sales of taxable supplies or cease trading altogether. Note that the VAT de-registration threshold is slightly lower than the VAT registration threshold.

### Specialist VAT Schemes

There are various different specialist VAT accounting schemes that traders can join, such as VAT retail schemes and the VAT flat rate scheme. These schemes have their own turnover entry thresholds, which differ from the initial VAT registration threshold.

## Hints and Tips

- Keep up to date with changes to VAT rules. HMRC provides regular "Business help and education emails".
- The mandatory VAT registration threshold is usually raised every year in the Chancellor's Budget and is applied for the forthcoming tax year.
- Accountants provide professional advice about VAT registration and suitable schemes, as well as guidance about record keeping.
