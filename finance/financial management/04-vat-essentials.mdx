## What is VAT?

Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on spending. It's charged on most goods and services sold in the UK. As a business, you collect VAT from your customers and pass it on to HMRC — you're essentially acting as a tax collector.

VAT applies at each stage of production and distribution, but it's the end consumer who ultimately pays the full amount.

## How VAT Works: Input Tax and Output Tax

VAT operates on a simple principle:

- **Output tax** is the VAT you charge your customers when you sell goods or services
- **Input tax** is the VAT you pay your suppliers when you buy goods or services for your business

At the end of each VAT period (usually quarterly), you calculate the difference:

- If your output tax exceeds your input tax, you pay the difference to HMRC
- If your input tax exceeds your output tax, HMRC refunds the difference to you

This means VAT-registered businesses don't actually bear the cost of VAT — they pass it through.

## VAT Rates at a Glance

| Rate | Percentage | What It Covers |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Standard | 20% | Most goods and services supplied in the UK |
| Reduced | 5% | Domestic fuel and power, energy-saving products, renovation of certain buildings, children's car seats, some healthcare products |
| Zero | 0% | Children's clothes, most food (excluding restaurant meals and catering), books and newspapers |

Zero-rated goods are still classed as taxable supplies — the rate is simply 0%. This distinction matters because you can still reclaim input tax on purchases related to zero-rated sales.

## Exempt Supplies and Partial Exemption

Some supplies are **exempt** from VAT entirely. This is different from zero-rated: exempt supplies don't count towards your taxable turnover, and you can't reclaim input tax on costs related to them.

Exempt supplies are common in sectors where many social ventures operate:

- **Financial services** — including some grant-funded activities
- **Education and training** — if provided by an eligible body
- **Health and welfare** — many care and support services
- **Insurance**
- **Some property transactions**

If your social venture delivers a mix of taxable and exempt services, you may be **partially exempt**. This means you can only reclaim input tax on the portion of your costs that relate to taxable supplies. Partial exemption can be complex — it's worth getting professional advice if this applies to you.

## Do You Need to Register?

You **must** register for VAT when:

- Your **taxable turnover** (the total value of VAT-liable sales) exceeds **£90,000** in any rolling 12-month period, or
- You expect it to exceed **£90,000 in the next 30 days** alone (for example, if you win a large contract)

Registration is by **taxable person**, not by business. If you're a sole trader running two ventures whose combined turnover exceeds the threshold, you must register.

Exempt supplies don't count towards the threshold. Only taxable supplies (standard-rated, reduced-rated and zero-rated) are included.

Failing to register on time can result in fines from HMRC, plus you'll owe VAT on sales you should have been charging for.

<Note>
The VAT registration threshold can change at each Budget. Check GOV.UK for the current figure.

## Voluntary Registration: When It Makes Sense

You can register for VAT before reaching the mandatory threshold. This is worth considering if:

- **You mainly sell to other VAT-registered businesses** — they can reclaim the VAT you charge, so it doesn't increase their costs
- **You're spending heavily on start-up costs** — registration lets you reclaim VAT on equipment, fit-out, professional fees, and other set-up expenses
- **You want to appear more established** — a VAT number can signal credibility to larger contract partners

The trade-off is added admin: you'll need to charge VAT, keep VAT records, and file quarterly returns.

## How to Register

Most businesses register online at [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration/how-to-register). This also creates your VAT online account (Government Gateway) for filing returns.

You must register **by post** if you're applying for a registration exception, importing goods, or joining the Agricultural Flat Rate Scheme.

HMRC typically issues your VAT registration certificate and number within **30 days**. Your **effective registration date** is the date your taxable turnover exceeded the threshold (or the date you requested voluntary registration).

## Making Tax Digital for VAT

All VAT-registered businesses must keep digital VAT records and submit returns through compatible software — you can no longer file paper returns or use HMRC's old online portal.

Compatible software includes Xero, QuickBooks, FreeAgent, and others. HMRC also provides free basic tools for smaller businesses. See [Setting Up Your Books](/finance/financial management/02-setting-up-your-books) for more on choosing software.

## De-registering for VAT

You can apply to de-register if your taxable turnover falls below the **de-registration threshold** (currently £88,000 — slightly lower than the registration threshold), or if you stop making taxable supplies altogether.

You must de-register within **30 days** of the reason arising, or you may face a penalty. You'll need to file a final VAT return accounting for any stock and assets you hold.

## What to Expect from a VAT Inspection

HMRC can inspect your business to check your VAT records and returns are accurate. They must normally give you **seven days' notice** before visiting your premises.

During an inspection, HMRC will typically:

- Examine your business records and VAT account
- Check that you're charging the correct VAT rates
- Review your VAT returns for accuracy
- Inspect your premises if relevant

The frequency depends on the size and complexity of your business and your track record. Keeping accurate, well-organised records is the best preparation.
