## Why Financial Management Matters

Financial management isn't just about keeping HMRC happy. For a social venture, it's the foundation that lets you deliver on your mission sustainably. Good financial management means you can:

- Pay your team and suppliers on time
- Report credibly to funders and your board
- Spot problems before they become crises
- Make confident decisions about growth, hiring, and investment

You don't need to be an accountant. You do need to understand what's going on with your money.

## The Three Pillars: Income, Expenditure, Visibility

Everything in financial management comes back to three things:

**Income** — know what your customers, commissioners, and funders owe you, and get that money in as quickly as possible. Don't let invoices sit unpaid for months while you wait politely.

**Expenditure** — keep up with what you owe others: landlords, suppliers, employees, HMRC. Pay on time. Don't commit to costs you can't cover.

**Visibility** — know your financial position at all times. Understand when shortfalls are coming and take steps to fix them before they become emergencies. A cash flow forecast and a simple budget will give you this.

If you can stay on top of these three things, you're ahead of many small organisations.

## Your First Obligations by Legal Structure

What you need to do depends on how your social venture is set up.

### Sole Trader

- Register for **Self-Assessment** with HMRC
- Set up a **separate business bank account** (not legally required, but makes everything clearer)
- Keep records of all income and expenses
- File a **Self-Assessment tax return** by 31 January each year

### Limited Company or CIC

- Register with **Companies House** and file **annual accounts** (within 9 months of your financial year-end)
- File a **Corporation Tax return** with HMRC (within 12 months of your accounting period end)
- Pay **Corporation Tax** (within 9 months and one day)
- If you employ anyone (including yourself via salary), set up **PAYE**
- If turnover exceeds **£90,000**, register for **VAT**

Don't worry if this feels like a lot. Each of these is covered in detail later in this guide.

## Where to Find Support

You don't have to work this out alone. There are people and organisations who can help:

- **Your regional LEP** (Local Enterprise Partnership) — works across the commercial, voluntary, and social venture space to support business development. What's available varies by area, so check what's on offer locally.
- **Local CVS or infrastructure organisations** — such as GMCVO (Greater Manchester), Brighton & Hove's business support pages, or your local Council for Voluntary Service. Many offer free or subsidised financial management workshops.
- **HMRC** — provides free online guidance, webinars, and basic payroll software. Their helplines can answer straightforward tax questions.
- **Adrian Ashton** — [adrianashton.co.uk](https://adrianashton.co.uk) — a well-known social venture adviser who shares free resources on financial management, business planning, and governance.
- **UnLtd** — provides funding, mentoring, and practical resources for social entrepreneurs, including finance templates and checklists.

And of course, a good accountant who understands social ventures can save you time, money, and stress (see [Choosing an Accountant](/finance/financial management/08-choosing-an-accountant)).
