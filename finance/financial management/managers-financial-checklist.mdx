## Introduction

This checklist is part of Mango's guide to financial management for NGOs. It provides a structured set of questions for managers to review their organisation's financial health and controls.

## Accounting Records

- Are the books of account up to date, reconciled and in good order?
- Are supporting documents filed and complete?
- Could you follow a complete transaction from start to finish through the accounting records?
- Does the bank reconciliation show any unusual or unexplained items or activities (e.g. old cheques, delayed banking of cash)?
- Is the Chart of Accounts up-to-date, user-friendly and available to everyone who needs it?

## Financial Statements

- Is income broadly in line with expenditure, or as planned?
- Is there enough cash available to pay off immediate debts?
- How long ago since the last external audit was conducted?
- What was the auditor's opinion? If it was a qualified opinion, what action has been taken?

## Budget Monitoring Reports

- Are reports circulated regularly and promptly?
- Is income and expenditure broadly in line with the budget?
- Are there any unusual variances? Are they properly explained?
- Are linked budget items behaving consistently?
- Do the figures match the narrative progress reports?

## Internal Control

- Is there adequate separation of duties in practice?
- Complete a spot check on the cash — are there any "IOUs" or unexplained shortages?
- Is there a higher than usual use of cash?
- Complete a spot check on the salaries records — look for "ghost workers" and check that tax has been paid to the authorities
- Is there one supplier who suddenly seems to be used more often than others?
- Check the assets register — is all equipment listed and where it is supposed to be?
- Are insurance policies up to date?
- Are the safe, stock room and cash box keys kept secure at all times?

## Behavioural Change

- Does anyone display lifestyle changes — such as new spending patterns (e.g. new car/clothes) or signs of alcohol/drug abuse?
- Is there someone who is always the first in and last out of the office and takes no holidays?
