## Cash Flow Management Top Tips

A presentation covering the key principles and practical actions for effective cash flow management.

## Let's Not Overcomplicate It...

**INCOME:** Make sure you know what customers owe you and get that money in as quickly as possible.

**EXPENDITURE:** Keep up with what you owe others (landlords, suppliers, employees, etc.) and make sure that they are paid on time. Don't incur more costs than you can afford to pay.

**IDENTIFY:** Know when there are shortfalls and take the necessary steps to fix them as quickly as possible.

## How Do You Make This Happen?

- Don't let customers delay payments
- Negotiate your bills-in payment terms to extend as long as possible
- Use a cash flow management tool or accounting software
- Incentivise customers
- Build reserves
