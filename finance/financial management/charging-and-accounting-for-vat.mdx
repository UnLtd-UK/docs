## Introduction

Following registration for Value Added Tax (VAT), VAT-registered traders are responsible for charging the correct amount of VAT to customers, keeping VAT records and a VAT account, submitting VAT returns and paying any VAT due to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). Traders can also reclaim the VAT paid on certain purchases made before registration (subject to time limits) as well as reclaiming VAT paid on purchases following registration.

The legislation covering VAT is complex and it is important to seek professional advice or contact HMRC for guidance to ensure compliance with current law.

## Starting to Charge VAT

Traders are required to register for VAT when their **taxable turnover** (the total value of their sales of goods and services that are liable for VAT) exceeds the mandatory VAT registration threshold.

Although traders must account to HMRC for VAT from their **effective registration date**, they cannot issue VAT invoices before being issued with a VAT number. Instead they can issue customers with a pro forma invoice indicating a total price that allows for VAT and state that a tax invoice will follow once the VAT number is received.

VAT must be charged by VAT-registered traders on any taxable supplies that are not exempt, including:

- Sales made in the course of business
- Items hired or loaned out
- Business assets that are sold
- Commission
- Business goods used for personal reasons
- Items bartered, given as gifts or part-exchanged

VAT must be accounted for on the full value of each item. Where VAT is not shown on an invoice, the total price recorded is treated by HMRC as having included VAT.

## VAT Rates

VAT must be charged at the correct rate, and the trader's VAT registration number and the rate of VAT charged must be shown on invoices.

| Rate | Percentage | Applies To |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Standard rate | 20% | Most goods and services supplied in the UK |
| Reduced rate | 5% | Domestic fuel and power, energy-saving products, renovation of certain buildings, children's car seats, some healthcare products |
| Zero rate | 0% | Children's clothes, food (with exclusions), books and newspapers, exports outside the EU |

### Exempt Supplies

Exempt supplies are excluded from taxable turnover (input tax cannot be recovered) and are commonly found in:

- Financial services
- Education
- Insurance
- Health and welfare services
- Some property transactions

## Calculating the Price and Amount of VAT to Charge

To calculate the price including VAT at the **standard 20% rate**, multiply the VAT-exclusive price by **1.2**.

> Example: £150 x 1.2 = £180 (total price including VAT)

To calculate the price including VAT at the **reduced 5% rate**, multiply the VAT-exclusive price by **1.05**.

To find the net sale price from a VAT-inclusive price, divide by 1.2 (or 1.05 for the reduced rate).

> Example: £150 ÷ 1.2 = £125 (net sale price), so the VAT included is £25.

## What Must Be Shown on VAT Invoices?

The main details required on a VAT invoice are:

- An identifying invoice number
- The trader's name, address and VAT registration number
- The date the invoice is issued (must be within 30 days of the date of supply)
- The customer's name and address
- A clear description of the goods or services supplied
- A quantity and unit price, plus the rate of VAT applicable
- Details of any cash discount offered
- The total amount payable excluding VAT
- The amount of VAT charged

Retailers do not have to provide a VAT invoice for every transaction (as they primarily sell to consumers), but must issue one if a taxable person requests it.

## Record Keeping for VAT Accounting

Once a trader is VAT registered, the following ledgers should be maintained:

- **Sales ledger** — records each VAT invoice issued to customers, showing sales turnover (excluding VAT) and the output tax charged
- **Purchase ledger** — records each invoice received from suppliers, showing purchase turnover (excluding VAT) and the input tax charged
- **Cash ledger** — records other cash sales and purchases not recorded in the sales or purchase ledgers, along with any relevant VAT
- **VAT account** — records the output tax charged to customers and input tax charged by suppliers, showing the net amount of VAT to be paid to or claimed back from HMRC

Computerised accounting software greatly simplifies recording VAT transactions and producing reports for VAT returns.

## What is a VAT Return?

All taxable persons must complete and submit regular online VAT returns to HMRC. The return summarises VAT transactions during the reporting period and identifies the amount of VAT to be paid or refunded.

VAT returns are most commonly completed **quarterly**. Traders are allocated four accounting period end dates from one of three options:

- 31 January, 30 April, 31 July, 31 October
- 28 February, 31 May, 31 August, 30 November
- 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, 31 December

At the end of each accounting period, traders have a further month to complete their VAT return.

## VAT Accounting Schemes

### Standard Accounting Scheme

Output VAT is levied as soon as a sales invoice is issued; input VAT is reclaimable as soon as a purchase invoice is received. Payment dates are irrelevant. Quarterly returns are filed and VAT owed is paid at the end of the next month.

### Cash Accounting Scheme

Available to firms with taxable turnover under **£1,350,000**. VAT is accounted for based on when customers actually pay and when the firm pays its suppliers — meaning traders don't pay VAT to HMRC until they've received the money from customers.

### Annual Accounting Scheme

Available to traders with turnover under **£1,350,000**. Only one annual VAT return is submitted, with regular interim payments of a fixed amount. The annual return is submitted within two months of the accounting year end.

### Flat-Rate Scheme

Available to traders with taxable turnover under **£150,000**. Traders calculate their VAT payment using a fixed percentage of their VAT-inclusive turnover, with different percentages for different trade sectors. Newly registered businesses use the flat rate for their sector minus 1%.

### Retail Schemes

For traders making the majority of sales to the general public. These simplify invoicing rules — a VAT invoice doesn't have to be issued unless the trader is asked for one.

## Accounting for VAT Through the VAT Return

The VAT return includes nine boxes covering VAT due on sales and other outputs, VAT on purchases, total sales and purchases, and the amount to be paid or reclaimed.

**Transactions that should NOT be included in a VAT return:**

- VAT payments to, or repayments from, HMRC
- Wages or salaries paid to employees
- PAYE, National Insurance, student loan and pension contributions
- Loans, dividends or drawings
- Business rates

## Paying VAT

Payments should be made electronically (Direct Debit, online banking, debit/credit card, Bacs or CHAPS).

For a return period ending 31 March:

- Return due to be submitted by **30 April**
- Payment by Bacs due by **7 May** (or the fifth working day of the month, whichever is earliest)
- Payment collected by Direct Debit on **10 May**

Traders with difficulty paying should contact HMRC to request an extension.

## HMRC Penalties

HMRC can impose penalties on traders who:

- File incorrect VAT returns
- Fail to file by the deadline
- Fail to pay VAT due by the deadline

Penalties for incorrect returns are based on the reason for the inaccuracy. If a trader can prove they took **reasonable care**, no penalties are incurred. It is advisable to disclose any inaccuracies to HMRC as soon as they are noticed.

Penalty rates for late filing/payment are based on net tax due and vary by turnover:

- No surcharge for the first default
- 10% of net tax for the fifth default
- 15% of net tax for subsequent defaults (for firms with turnover under £150,000/year)

Traders have 30 days to appeal. It is not acceptable to claim reliance on a bookkeeper or accountant who did not submit the return on time.

## Hints and Tips

- Keep up to date with changes to VAT rules via HMRC's "Business help and education emails"
- Backdated claims to recover VAT paid before registration can be made but are subject to time limits
- File accurate VAT returns within deadlines and pay VAT due promptly to avoid penalties
