## Introduction

Accountants provide small business owners with a range of professional advice and taxation services, including bookkeeping, preparing financial statements, calculating tax and providing advice about minimising tax and other costs.

## Services Provided by Accountants

- **Start-up advice** — advice about the best legal status for a business (sole trader, partnership, limited company, LLP, community interest company) and help with legal and taxation issues
- **Bookkeeping** — a full bookkeeping service or advice about which records should be kept for accounting and tax purposes
- **VAT (Value Added Tax)** — advice about the best VAT accounting scheme for the business and the applicable VAT rules
- **Preparing annual accounts** — producing key annual financial statements such as the profit and loss account and balance sheet; filing accounts with Companies House for limited companies and LLPs
- **Preparing tax returns** — advice about tax rules, regulations, exemptions and case law; achieving tax savings; and presenting a case to HMRC in the event of an investigation or dispute
- **Business advice / management accounting** — setting up systems to monitor performance and budgets, improve efficiency, and provide specialist advice on financial planning and investments

## Finding an Accountant

Start with existing business contacts who may be able to make recommendations. Local enterprise agencies or a bank's business relationship manager may also help.

## Choosing an Accountant

Key issues to consider:

- **Check qualifications** — look for letters after their name: ACA/FCA (chartered accountant), CA (Scotland), ACCA/FCCA (chartered certified accountant), or ACMA/FCMA (chartered management accountant). These indicate they have passed numerous examinations and have several years' practical experience.
- **Professional body membership matters** — unqualified accountants may offer cheaper rates but could cost more in the long run. Members of leading bodies must maintain up-to-date technical knowledge through continuing professional development.
- **Sector experience** — ensure the accountant understands your business and sector, and has experience working with smaller businesses.
- **Meet in person** — contact more than one firm and have face-to-face meetings before deciding. Look for someone who is both qualified and empathetic.
- **Check initial consultation fees** — some firms waive the fee for the first meeting unless specific advice is given.

## The Letter of Engagement

When appointing a new accountant, they will issue a letter of engagement — the contract between the business and the accountant. It should set out:

- The accountant's responsibilities
- The business's responsibilities
- The fees and payment details

Meet regularly with your accountant and arrange additional meetings when critical issues arise (e.g. cash flow problems). Keep records of correspondence and supply information well in advance of filing deadlines.

## Accountants' Fees and Charges

Charges vary according to location, business size and complexity, and the size of the accountancy firm.

| Service | Typical Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Annual accounts and tax calculations (sole trader, not VAT-registered) | From around £150 |
| Annual accounts for Companies House (larger, VAT-registered business) | At least £2,000 |
| Fixed monthly fee for standard accountancy services (small business) | £60 – £250/month |
| Hourly rate | At least £25 – £35/hour |

Fees may vary depending on the seniority of the person doing the work. If charges are not based on a fixed fee, request an estimate so the final bill can be challenged if it exceeds it.

## Dealing with Disputes

- Accountants who break the law or their professional codes of conduct are liable to disciplinary action by their professional body.
- Most practising accountants must hold **indemnity insurance** that protects clients from loss caused by negligence.
- For substantial losses, consult a lawyer — professional bodies will not help with seeking compensation.
- Fee disputes may be resolved through a **small claims court**. ICAS also operates a fee arbitration scheme.

## Hints and Tips

- Engage an accountant before starting a new business
- Always investigate a prospective accountant's reputation before engaging them
- For specialised areas (audit, investment business, insolvency work), ensure the accountant is authorised for that type of work
- Inform your accountant as soon as possible of any developments affecting the financial circumstances of the business
- Review and agree the accountant's charges annually
