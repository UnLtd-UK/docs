## Sources of Support: General

A great source of support in this area are the regional LEPs (Learning and Enterprise Partnerships), which work between the commercial, voluntary and social enterprise space and support regional business development. Each area operates differently — take a look online, and also at your local CVS (or GMCVO for those in Greater Manchester) for support.

The UK government's guide to company accounts includes lots of information, including obligations for CICs.

## Accountancy and Bookkeeping Firms

The following firms are either social enterprises themselves, or provide specifically for social businesses. These have mostly come recommended by other award winners. Reach out to at least three providers for comparables in both services and cost.

- **Social Enterprise UK** — management accounting, financial director support, general bookkeeping, accounting and management accounts. Free one-hour consultation.
- **Green Accountancy** — also recommended, believed to offer a free one-hour consultancy.
- **Social Enterprise Accounts CIC** — a smaller, Plymouth-based outfit worth exploring for those nearby.
- **Social Enterprise Accountancy Scotland CIC** — recommended for those in Scotland (contact: sheila@seas-cic.com).
- **Accounting for Good CIC** and **Harris Accountancy** — also worth considering.

## Back to Basics: General Hints and Tips

### Recording Your Finances

- If you haven't maintained business accounts before, the **Start Up Loans company** provides a free template. The Cash Flow Forecast supports financial forecasting and comes with a user guide. Note the Personal Survival Budget tab.
- **Microsoft Office / Excel** is a common go-to. A free version of Excel is available in OneDrive (with an Outlook/Hotmail account). Google Sheets is also free via Gmail.
- For more advanced reporting, consider **Xero** or **QuickBooks** (monthly subscription, most have free trials).

### Delegating to Professionals

- **Chartered Accountants** are registered with a professional body, have a minimum of three years' training and passed financial management exams.
- **Bookkeepers** specialise in recording financial transactions. Find qualified bookkeepers at the International Association of Bookkeepers and the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers. You'll still need an accountant at year-end for statutory accounts, but a bookkeeper may reduce set-up costs.

### Choosing an Accountant

- Check qualifications: ACA/FCA (CA in Scotland), ACCA/FCCA, or ACMA/FCMA
- Members of approved bodies must maintain up-to-date technical knowledge through CPD
- Look for sector experience and/or startup experience
- Meet more than one firm before deciding — check whether the first consultation is free

## Quick Reminders

- **Sole traders:** register for self-assessment with HMRC and set up a separate business bank account
- **Limited companies:** file annual accounts with Companies House and a tax return with HMRC
- **Filing tax returns yourself:** allow plenty of time — the UK government website will guide you through
- **VAT threshold:** if turnover exceeds £85,000, you may need to register for VAT
