## Tax Obligations by Business Structure

Your tax responsibilities depend on how your social venture is set up. Here's what applies to each structure.

### Sole Trader

If you run your social venture on your own, you pay **income tax** on your business profits:

| Band | Rate | Income Range |
|------|------|-------------|
| Personal allowance | 0% | Up to £12,570 |
| Basic rate | 20% | £12,571 – £50,270 |
| Higher rate | 40% | £50,271 – £125,140 |
| Additional rate | 45% | Over £125,140 |

You also pay **National Insurance**:

- **Class 2:** A fixed weekly amount (£3.50/week) if profits exceed £6,845
- **Class 4:** 9% on profits between £12,570 and £50,270, plus 2% on profits above £50,270

You must register as self-employed with HMRC and file a **Self-Assessment tax return** each year. The online filing deadline is **31 January** following the end of the tax year (5 April).

### Partnership

If two or more people run the social venture together, each partner pays income tax on their share of the profits at the same rates as sole traders. Each partner also pays Class 2 and Class 4 National Insurance on their share.

The partnership must submit a **Partnership Tax Return (SA800)**. Each partner then files their own individual Self-Assessment for their share of the profits.

### Community Interest Company (CIC)

CICs are a popular structure for social ventures. As a type of limited company, a CIC pays **corporation tax** on its profits:

| Rate | Applies To |
|------|-----------|
| Small profits rate: 19% | Profits up to £50,000 |
| Main rate: 25% | Profits above £250,000 |

Between £50,000 and £250,000, marginal relief applies.

CICs must file **annual accounts** and a **confirmation statement** with Companies House, plus a **Corporation Tax return** with HMRC. Payment is due nine months and one day after your accounting period ends.

If your CIC has a turnover exceeding £90,000, you must also register for VAT (see [VAT Essentials](/finance/financial management/04-vat-essentials)).

**Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR)** may be available to investors in your CIC, which can help attract funding.

### Limited Company

A limited company is a separate legal entity from you as an individual. It pays **corporation tax** at the same rates as CICs.

When paying yourself from a limited company, you have two main options:

- **Salary** — subject to income tax and National Insurance. You must operate PAYE to deduct these.
- **Dividends** — taxed at lower rates after a £1,000 tax-free allowance: 8.75% (basic), 33.75% (higher), 39.35% (additional)

Many social venture directors use a combination of a modest salary and dividends to be tax-efficient.

You must file a **Corporation Tax return** annually and submit company accounts to Companies House.

## Allowable Business Expenses

Regardless of your structure, you can deduct legitimate business costs from your taxable profits. Common allowable expenses include:

- **Premises** — rent, utilities, business rates, insurance
- **Home office** — a proportion of home costs (rent, heating, electricity, internet), typically calculated by dividing bills by the number of rooms used for business
- **Travel** — business-related journeys (fuel at 45p per mile for the first 10,000 miles, public transport, parking, accommodation)
- **Vehicle costs** — servicing, MOTs, replacement parts, breakdown cover (business use only)
- **Equipment** — computers, phones, furniture, software
- **Marketing** — advertising, website costs, promotional materials
- **Professional services** — accountant fees, legal fees, consultancy
- **Staff costs** — salaries, wages, employer NI contributions
- **Insurance** — public liability, professional indemnity, employer's liability
- **R&D costs** — enhanced tax relief may be available (see [Innovation Funding](/finance/financial management/09-funding-and-tax-relief))

Keep receipts and records for everything you claim. HMRC can ask to see them at any time.

Missing a deadline can mean automatic fines and interest charges. Set calendar reminders well in advance.

## Making Tax Digital

HMRC is moving to digital-only tax reporting. **Making Tax Digital for VAT** is already mandatory for VAT-registered businesses — you must keep digital records and file VAT returns through compatible software.

From **April 2026**, Making Tax Digital extends to **Income Tax** for self-employed individuals and landlords with income above £50,000. This means you'll need to submit quarterly updates through compatible software instead of a single annual return.

If you're not already using accounting software, now is a good time to start (see [Setting Up Your Books](/finance/financial management/02-setting-up-your-books)).
