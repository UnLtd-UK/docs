## Why Innovation Funding Matters for Social Ventures

Innovation isn't just about technology. Social Ventures innovate in how services are delivered, how communities are engaged, and how social problems are solved. Many of the UK's R&D funding programmes recognise this — and some, like the Small Business Research Initiative, are specifically designed to fund solutions to public sector challenges.

If your social venture is developing a new product, process, or service, there's likely a funding programme or tax relief that can help.

## Innovate UK Programmes

Innovate UK is the UK's national innovation agency, part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). It provides funding and support to help businesses turn ideas into commercial reality.

### Funding Competitions

Innovate UK runs regular competitions offering **£25,000 to £10 million** for R&D projects. Funding can be used to:

- Test and develop an innovative idea
- Create new knowledge or develop a new process, product, or service
- Work with other organisations on collaborative projects

The **Open Funding Programme** is available year-round and supports innovative businesses with high growth potential. Check the Innovate UK website for current competitions — themes rotate and some are specifically aimed at social innovation.

### Knowledge Transfer Partnerships

Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs) connect your business with a university or college to work on a project of strategic importance. Here's how they work:

- Your social venture partners with an academic institution
- Together, you recruit a recent graduate (the "Associate") to work on the project
- The project runs for **12 to 36 months**
- Costs are part-funded by government, with the balance from your organisation
- Applications can be submitted throughout the year

KTPs are particularly useful if you need specialist expertise — data analysis, service design, impact measurement — that you don't have in-house.

### Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI)

SBRI is especially relevant for social ventures. It funds innovative solutions to **public sector challenges** — exactly the space many social ventures operate in.

- Successful applicants receive a contract (not a grant) for the full cost of demonstrating feasibility
- Follow-on funding is available for prototype development
- You retain your intellectual property rights
- The programme generates real business opportunities, particularly for early-stage SMEs

SBRI competitions are published on the Innovate UK website and cover areas like health, education, transport, and community services.

## R&D Tax Relief

If your social venture pays corporation tax, you may be able to claim R&D tax relief on qualifying expenditure. This reduces your tax bill or, if you're loss-making, provides a cash credit.

### SME Scheme

For small and medium-sized enterprises:

- Claim **an additional 86% deduction** on qualifying R&D costs (on top of the normal 100% deduction)
- If loss-making, you can surrender the loss for a cash credit
- Qualifying costs include staff costs, materials, software, and subcontractor fees directly related to R&D

### RDEC Scheme

The Research and Development Expenditure Credit is mainly for larger companies, but also applies to SMEs sub-contracted by a larger company:

- Provides a **20% tax credit** on qualifying R&D expenditure
- Claimed as a credit against your corporation tax bill

Claims can only be made for projects that seek to achieve a scientific or technological advance — but this is interpreted broadly. Developing a new digital platform, testing a novel service delivery model, or creating new materials can all qualify.

## The Patent Box

If your social venture has developed and patented an invention, the **Patent Box** lets you apply a reduced **10% corporation tax rate** to profits earned from that invention, instead of the standard 19–25%.

To qualify:

- Your company must be liable for corporation tax
- You must own or have exclusive rights to the patents
- You must have undertaken qualifying development work on the patented invention

This is a niche relief, but can be valuable if your social venture has developed proprietary technology or processes.
