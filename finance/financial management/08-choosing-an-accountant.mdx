## What Can an Accountant Do for You?

A good accountant does more than file your tax return. For a social venture, the right accountant can:

- **Advise on your structure** — whether a CIC, limited company, charity, or sole trader best fits your mission and finances
- **Handle bookkeeping** — or advise you on which records to keep and how
- **Manage VAT** — recommend the best scheme, file returns, and handle HMRC queries
- **Prepare annual accounts** — produce profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and file with Companies House
- **File tax returns** — calculate what you owe, apply reliefs, and handle HMRC correspondence
- **Provide strategic advice** — budgeting, cash flow forecasting, scenario planning, and financial reporting for funders and boards

If you're at the stage of applying for grants or investment, an accountant who understands social venture can help you present your finances in a way that builds funder confidence.

## Finding the Right Accountant

### Professional Body Directories

Start by looking for accountants registered with one of the main professional bodies:

| Body | Acronym | Website |
|------|---------|---------|
| Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales | ICAEW | icaew.com |
| Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland | ICAS | icas.com |
| Chartered Accountants Ireland | CAI | charteredaccountants.ie |
| Association of Chartered Certified Accountants | ACCA | accaglobal.com |
| Chartered Institute of Management Accountants | CIMA | cimaglobal.com |

All of these directories let you search for accountants by location and specialisation.

### What Qualifications to Look For

The letters after an accountant's name tell you about their training:

- **ACA / FCA** — Chartered Accountant (England and Wales). Passed rigorous exams and has at least three years' practical experience.
- **CA** — Chartered Accountant (Scotland). Equivalent to ACA.
- **ACCA / FCCA** — Chartered Certified Accountant. Internationally recognised qualification.
- **ACMA / FCMA** — Chartered Management Accountant. Specialises in business strategy and management accounting.

Members of these bodies must keep their knowledge up to date through continuing professional development. An unqualified accountant may offer cheaper rates but could cost you more in the long run through missed tax reliefs or compliance errors.

### Why Sector Experience Matters

Social Ventures have distinct needs — CIC asset locks, community benefit reporting, grant accounting, mixed income streams, and social investment structures. An accountant who has worked with organisations like yours will understand these from the start, rather than learning on your time.

Ask prospective accountants whether they've worked with CICs, charities, or social ventures before, and ask for references.

## Social Venture Specialist Providers

These firms either specialise in social ventures or are social ventures themselves:

- **Social Enterprise UK** — management accounting, financial director support, general bookkeeping, and management accounts. Offers a free one-hour consultation.
- **Green Accountancy** — comes recommended by social entrepreneurs. Believed to offer a free initial consultation.
- **Social Enterprise Accounts CIC** — a smaller, Plymouth-based practice specialising in social businesses.
- **Social Enterprise Accountancy Scotland CIC (SEAS)** — recommended for social ventures in Scotland. Contact: sheila@seas-cic.com
- **Accounting for Good CIC** — focused on charities and social ventures.
- **Harris Accountancy** — also recommended by social entrepreneurs.

Reach out to at least three providers so you can compare services and costs.

## The Letter of Engagement

When you appoint an accountant, they'll issue a **letter of engagement** — the formal contract between you. It should set out:

- What the accountant will do for you (and what they won't)
- What you're responsible for (providing records on time, keeping them informed of changes)
- Fees, payment terms, and how charges are calculated

Read it carefully. If anything is unclear, ask before signing.

## Typical Fees and Charges

Costs vary by location, business size, and the accountancy firm. Here's a rough guide:

| Service | Typical Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Annual accounts and tax (sole trader, not VAT-registered) | From around £150 |
| Annual accounts for Companies House (larger, VAT-registered business) | At least £2,000 |
| Monthly package for standard services (small business) | £60 – £250/month |
| Hourly rate | £25 – £35/hour minimum |

If charges aren't based on a fixed fee, ask for an estimate upfront so you can challenge the final bill if it comes in significantly higher.

Fees may vary depending on who does the work — a senior partner will cost more per hour than a junior accountant or bookkeeper.

## Working Effectively with Your Accountant

To get the most value:

- **Meet regularly** — at least quarterly, not just at year-end. Discuss cash flow, upcoming costs, and any changes to your income.
- **Provide information early** — don't dump a year's worth of receipts on your accountant a week before the filing deadline.
- **Tell them about changes promptly** — new contracts, staff hires, cash flow problems, or structural changes. The sooner they know, the better they can advise.
- **Keep records of correspondence** — emails, notes from meetings, and any advice they give you.

## Dealing with Disputes

If something goes wrong:

- **Indemnity insurance** — most practising accountants must hold professional indemnity insurance. If their negligence causes you a financial loss, you can make a claim.
- **Fee disputes** — if you think you've been overcharged, raise it with the firm first. If that doesn't resolve it, ICAS operates a fee arbitration scheme, and you can take the matter to the small claims court.
- **Professional conduct** — if an accountant breaches their professional code, their professional body can take disciplinary action. Contact the relevant body directly.
- **Substantial losses** — for significant financial harm caused by negligence, consult a solicitor. Professional bodies won't help you seek compensation directly.
