## Overview

These updates span various areas and may impact individuals, businesses, and charities.

## Personal Taxation & National Insurance

**Income Tax and NIC Thresholds:** The freeze on income tax and National Insurance (NIC) thresholds, originally set to end in 2026, has been extended through 2028. This keeps thresholds at current levels (£12,570 for the personal allowance), meaning that as wages rise, individuals may find themselves paying more tax due to inflation.

**National Living Wage:** The National Living Wage for those aged 23 and over will rise from £11.44 to £12.21 per hour as of April 2025. Additional increases apply for younger age groups and apprentices:

- Ages 18–20: increasing from £8.60 to £10.00 per hour
- Under-18s and apprentices: increasing from £6.40 to £7.55 per hour

**State Pension and Benefits Uprating:** The government will maintain the State Pension Triple Lock, with pensions rising by 4.1% in 2025–26, benefiting over 12 million pensioners. Working-age benefits will also increase in line with the September 2024 CPI inflation rate of 1.7%.

## Business Taxation

**Corporation Tax:** The main corporation tax rate, set at 25% in April 2023, remains unchanged. The government has confirmed the continuation of full expensing for qualifying capital investments, enabling businesses to offset these expenses against taxable profits.

**Employment Allowance:** Previously capped at £5,000, the Employment Allowance will increase to £10,500 from April 2025. The £100,000 eligibility threshold has been removed, enabling more businesses to benefit.

**Employer NICs:** Employer NICs will rise by 1.2%, from 13.8% to 15%, starting April 2025. The secondary threshold will decrease from £9,100 to £5,000, likely impacting businesses with larger payrolls.

## Capital Gains Tax (CGT)

**Rate Increases:**

| Taxpayer | Previous Rate | New Rate |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Basic-rate (most assets) | 10% | 18% |
| Higher-rate (most assets) | 20% | 24% |
| Residential property (basic) | 18% | 18% (unchanged) |
| Residential property (higher) | 24% | 24% (unchanged) |

These changes are effective immediately and may impact gains from investments such as shares and other assets not protected within tax wrappers like ISAs.

**Annual Allowance:** The CGT allowance remains unchanged at £3,000.

## Inheritance Tax Reform for Pension Pots

From April 2027, pension pots inherited upon the account holder's death will be subject to inheritance tax, ending the previous exemption for beneficiaries if the account holder passed away before age 75. This will impact estate planning, particularly for those with substantial pension savings.

## Energy and Sustainability

**Energy Profits Levy:** The current levy of 35% will increase to 38% from November 2024. The 29% investment allowance for qualifying energy sector expenditures will be removed, and the levy is extended until 2030.

**Electric Vehicles and Sustainable Investments:** Tax incentives for electric vehicles in company car schemes will remain in place through 2028. New Vehicle Excise Duty rates will be implemented from April 2025, with enhanced EV incentives in Vehicle Excise Duty and Company Car Tax regimes.

## Business Rates and Sector-Specific Reliefs

**Retail, Hospitality, and Leisure:** 40% business rates relief for 2025–2026, capped at £110,000 per business. The small business rates multiplier will be frozen.

**Private Schools:** From April 2025, private schools will lose business rates relief, and VAT will be applied to private school fees.

**Stamp Duty Land Tax:** The rate on additional properties (second homes, buy-to-let) increases from 3% to 5%, aiming to support first-time and primary residence buyers.

**Alcohol Duty:** From February 2025, alcohol duty on draught products will be reduced by 1 penny per pint to support the hospitality sector.

## HMRC Compliance and Enforcement

The government has increased funding for HMRC to enhance compliance and enforcement, focusing on:

- Supply chain transparency
- Tightening regulations around umbrella companies
- Reducing tax avoidance schemes
- Recovering unpaid taxes with increased interest rates on overdue payments

## Next Steps

These changes introduce substantial updates across income, payroll, and business investments. If any of these adjustments may impact your financial plans or business operations, it may be worth contacting your accountant or financial advisor.
