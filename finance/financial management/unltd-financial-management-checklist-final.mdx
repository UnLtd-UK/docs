## Overview

This checklist is a working guide for reviewing the financial management practices of a social enterprise. Each item can be marked Yes/No with space for notes, follow-on resources, and assessor observations.

## Accounting Records

- Are the books of account up to date, reconciled and in good order?
- Are supporting documents filed and complete?
- Could you follow a complete transaction from start to finish through the accounting records?
- Is the Chart of Accounts up-to-date, user-friendly and available to everyone who needs it?
- Are they a largely electronic payment/receipt based business? *(If "No", they are cash-based — if so, why?)*
- Do they have an external accountant? *(Ideally with a close working relationship)*
- Can they produce documentation on request? (e.g. P&Ls, invoices) *(Many free invoicing tools available online)*
- Do they have an electronic accounts system in place? *(e.g. Xero or QuickBooks)*

## Financial Statements

- Is income broadly in line with expenditure, or as planned?
- Is there enough cash available to pay off immediate debts? *(Could also look into the company's liquidity if needed)*
- How long ago since the last external audit was conducted?
- What was the auditor's opinion? If it was a qualified opinion, what action has been taken?

## Budget Monitoring Reports

- Do they have budgets?
- Are reports circulated regularly and promptly?
- Do they provide appropriate reports for managers, budget holders, directors and NEDs?
- Is income and expenditure broadly in line with the budget?
- Are there any unusual variances? Are they properly explained?
- Are linked budget items behaving consistently?
- Do the figures match the narrative progress reports? *(You should be able to link their financial position and performance against the message they are selling to you. Numbers don't lie.)*

## Internal Control

- Is there adequate separation of duties in practice? *(Different people should raise and pay purchase orders, bills etc.)*
- Is there one supplier who suddenly seems to be used more often than others?
- Check the assets register — is all equipment listed and where it is supposed to be?
- Are policies up to date? *(e.g. insurance, sign-off power, payment deadlines)*

## Compliance

- Is the company VAT registered and paying VAT?
- Is the company paying PAYE appropriately?
- Is the company paying corporation tax?
- Have they met reporting requirements for Companies House?
- Are the correct shareholder arrangements in place?

## Cash Flow Management

- Has the company hit any cash flow problems over the previous 12 months?
- Will the company hit any cash flow problems over the next 12 months?
- Is the company in need of investment or working capital?
- Does the company struggle with budgeting or seasonal income?
- Does the company manage its income effectively? *(Short payment dates for invoices, managing cash, asking for deposits on large works, contracts in place)*
- Does the company manage its outgoings effectively? *(Payments made on time to suppliers)*
- Does the company have appropriate levels of stock?
- Does the company have reserves of at least 2 months?
- Does the company rely on multiple sources of income? *(i.e. 10+ clients or an appropriate number)*
- Does any single contract make up more than 50% of income?
- If the company has taken on a loan, is their debt coverage ratio greater than 1.15? *(Calculation: Projected operating income (EBITDA) / future debt repayments. Should be done quarterly.)*
