## What Records You Need to Keep

Whatever your business structure, you need to track money coming in and going out. If you're VAT-registered (or planning to be), you should maintain four core records:

- **Sales ledger** — every invoice you issue to customers, showing the sale amount (excluding VAT) and the output tax you charged
- **Purchase ledger** — every invoice you receive from suppliers, showing the purchase amount (excluding VAT) and the input tax you paid
- **Cash ledger** — any cash sales or purchases not captured in the other ledgers, along with any VAT
- **VAT account** — a running summary of your output and input tax, showing what you owe HMRC or what they owe you

Even if you're not VAT-registered, keeping proper sales and purchase records from day one will save you significant time when it comes to filing your tax return, applying for grants, or reporting to your board.

You must also keep **supporting documents** — receipts, bank statements, invoices, contracts — for at least **six years**. HMRC can ask to see them at any time.

## Starting Simple: Spreadsheets and Free Templates

You don't need expensive software to start. Many social ventures begin with a simple spreadsheet:

- **Start Up Loans** provides a free cash flow forecast template with a user guide. It includes a Personal Survival Budget tab to help you work out what salary you need to pay yourself.
- **Microsoft Excel** is widely used for basic bookkeeping. If you have a Hotmail or Outlook account, you get a free version of Excel through OneDrive.
- **Google Sheets** is free with any Gmail account and works well for collaborative bookkeeping if you have a co-founder or bookkeeper who needs access.

A spreadsheet works well when you have a small number of transactions per month. Once you're regularly processing invoices, managing VAT, or running payroll, it's usually time to move to dedicated software.

## Stepping Up to Accounting Software

Cloud-based accounting software automates much of what you'd otherwise do manually — invoicing, bank reconciliation, VAT returns, and financial reporting.

Popular options include:

- **Xero** — widely used by small businesses and accountants. Monthly subscription with free trials available.
- **QuickBooks** — similar functionality to Xero, also subscription-based with free trials.
- **FreeAgent** — designed for freelancers and small businesses, with a clean interface.
- **HMRC Basic Tools** — free payroll software if you just need to run PAYE for a small number of employees.

All of these are **Making Tax Digital compatible**, which you'll need if you're VAT-registered (and will need for Income Tax from April 2026).

When choosing software, check whether your accountant has a preference — most work closely with one or two platforms, and using the same one makes collaboration much smoother.

## Bookkeeper vs Accountant: What's the Difference?

These two roles complement each other, but they do different things:

**Bookkeepers** specialise in the day-to-day recording of financial transactions — entering invoices, reconciling bank statements, and keeping your records up to date. Qualified bookkeepers can be found through the International Association of Bookkeepers or the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers.

**Accountants** handle higher-level work — preparing your annual accounts, filing tax returns, advising on tax efficiency, and providing strategic financial advice. They're registered with professional bodies and hold formal qualifications (see [Choosing an Accountant](/finance/financial management/08-choosing-an-accountant)).

Many social ventures start by doing their own bookkeeping (or hiring a bookkeeper) and bring in an accountant for year-end statutory accounts and tax returns. This can be more cost-effective than paying accountant rates for routine data entry.

## Social Venture Accounting Providers

Several accountancy firms specialise in working with social ventures. They understand CIC structures, grant accounting, and the particular reporting needs of mission-driven organisations:

- **Social Enterprise UK** — management accounting, financial director support, general bookkeeping. Free one-hour consultation.
- **Green Accountancy** — recommended by social entrepreneurs, also offers a free initial consultation.
- **Social Enterprise Accounts CIC** — Plymouth-based, worth exploring if you're in the South West.
- **Social Enterprise Accountancy Scotland CIC (SEAS)** — specialist support for Scottish social ventures.
- **Accounting for Good CIC** — focused on charities and social ventures.
- **Harris Accountancy** — also comes recommended by social entrepreneurs.
