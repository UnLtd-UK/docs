## Starting to Charge VAT

Once you've applied for VAT registration, you must charge VAT from your **effective registration date** — even before you receive your VAT number. In the meantime, issue customers a pro forma invoice showing a total that includes VAT, and note that a full VAT invoice will follow once your number arrives.

VAT must be charged on all taxable supplies, including:

- Sales made in the course of business
- Items hired or loaned out
- Business assets you sell
- Commission you receive
- Business goods used for personal reasons
- Items bartered, given as gifts, or part-exchanged

If VAT isn't shown separately on an invoice, HMRC treats the total price as VAT-inclusive.

## Calculating VAT on Your Prices

To add **standard-rate VAT (20%)**, multiply the net price by **1.2**:

> £150 x 1.2 = **£180** (price including VAT)

To add **reduced-rate VAT (5%)**, multiply by **1.05**:

> £150 x 1.05 = **£157.50**

To find the net price from a VAT-inclusive figure, divide by 1.2 (or 1.05):

> £180 ÷ 1.2 = **£150** (net price), so the VAT is **£30**

## What Must Appear on a VAT Invoice

Every VAT invoice you issue must include:

- A unique invoice number
- Your business name, address, and VAT registration number
- The date the invoice is issued (within 30 days of the supply date)
- The customer's name and address
- A clear description of the goods or services supplied
- The quantity and unit price
- The VAT rate applied
- Any cash discount offered
- The total amount excluding VAT
- The VAT amount charged
- The total amount including VAT

**Retailers** don't need to issue a VAT invoice for every sale, but must provide one if a VAT-registered customer requests it.

## Filing Your VAT Return

VAT returns are filed **quarterly**. HMRC assigns you four period-end dates from one of three cycles:

- January, April, July, October
- February, May, August, November
- March, June, September, December

Your return summarises all VAT transactions for that quarter across **nine boxes**, covering output tax charged, input tax paid, and the net amount due. You have **one calendar month plus seven days** after the period end to file and pay electronically.

**Do not include** in your VAT return:

- VAT payments to or refunds from HMRC
- Wages and salaries
- PAYE, National Insurance, or pension contributions
- Loans, dividends, or personal drawings
- Business rates

## Choosing a VAT Scheme

HMRC offers several schemes to simplify VAT accounting. The right one depends on your turnover, cash flow, and how your social venture operates.

### Standard Accounting

The default scheme. You account for output VAT when you issue an invoice and reclaim input VAT when you receive a supplier invoice — regardless of when the money actually changes hands. Quarterly returns, payment due one month after the period ends.

### Cash Accounting

Available if your taxable turnover is under **£1,350,000**. VAT is accounted for when payments are actually made and received, not when invoices are issued. This is particularly useful for social ventures dealing with **slow-paying grant funders or local authorities** — you don't pay HMRC until the money arrives.

### Annual Accounting

Also available for turnover under **£1,350,000**. You submit **one return per year** instead of four, making regular interim payments of a fixed amount throughout the year. The annual return is due within two months of your accounting year-end. Good if you want to reduce admin.

### Flat-Rate Scheme

Available if your taxable turnover is under **£150,000**. Instead of tracking input and output VAT on every transaction, you pay a fixed percentage of your total VAT-inclusive turnover. The percentage varies by sector — for example, 14.5% for computer and IT consultancy or 12% for social work activities.

This suits **service-based social ventures** with few purchases, since the admin is much lighter. Newly registered businesses get a 1% discount in their first year.

The trade-off: you can't reclaim input VAT on individual purchases (except capital goods over £2,000).

### Retail Schemes

Designed for businesses making most sales directly to the public — useful if your social venture has a **shop, cafe, or trading arm**. These simplify how you calculate output VAT when issuing individual invoices isn't practical.

## Paying VAT to HMRC

You must pay electronically — Direct Debit, online banking, debit or credit card, Bacs, or CHAPS.

For a quarter ending 31 March:

- **Return due:** 30 April
- **Payment by Bacs:** 7 May (or the fifth working day of the month)
- **Direct Debit collection:** around 10 May

If you're struggling to pay on time, contact HMRC before the deadline to discuss a payment arrangement. They'd rather work with you than chase penalties.

## Avoiding Penalties

HMRC can penalise you for:

- **Incorrect returns** — penalties based on the reason for the error. If you can show you took **reasonable care**, no penalty applies. Always disclose mistakes as soon as you spot them — unprompted disclosure reduces any penalty.
- **Late filing** — a default surcharge system applies. No surcharge for your first late return, but repeated defaults within a 12-month "surcharge period" attract penalties of up to 15% of the VAT due.
- **Late payment** — interest accrues on overdue amounts.

You have **30 days to appeal** any penalty. Note that blaming your accountant or bookkeeper for a late return is not an accepted excuse.

The best protection is accurate record-keeping, timely filing, and paying what you owe on time. If you're using accounting software, set up reminders for your filing dates.
