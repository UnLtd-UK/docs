## What Changed for Employers

The Autumn Budget 2024 brought significant changes to employer costs, effective from April 2025.

**Employer National Insurance** rises from 13.8% to **15%**. At the same time, the secondary threshold (the point at which you start paying employer NI on each employee's earnings) drops from £9,100 to **£5,000**. Together, these changes increase the cost of employing people.

However, the **Employment Allowance** — which lets you reduce your employer NI bill — increases from £5,000 to **£10,500** per year. The previous £100,000 NI liability cap has also been removed, meaning more businesses can now claim it. For smaller social ventures, this increase may offset much or all of the NI rise.

**What this means in practice:** If your social venture has a small payroll (roughly under £100,000 in total wages), the Employment Allowance increase could cover your additional NI costs entirely. If you employ more people, you'll likely see a net increase.

## National Living Wage Increases

From April 2025, minimum wage rates rise across all age groups:

| Category | Previous Rate | New Rate |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| National Living Wage (21 and over) | £11.44/hour | £12.21/hour |
| 18–20 year olds | £8.60/hour | £10.00/hour |
| Under-18s and apprentices | £6.40/hour | £7.55/hour |

The 18–20 rate sees the largest jump. If your social venture employs young people or apprentices, factor these increases into your staffing budget.

## Corporation Tax and Capital Investment

The main corporation tax rate stays at **25%** (for profits above £250,000). The small profits rate of **19%** continues to apply to profits up to £50,000.

**Full expensing** for qualifying capital investments continues — meaning you can deduct the full cost of qualifying plant and machinery from your taxable profits in the year you buy them. This is relevant if your social venture is investing in equipment, vehicles, or fit-out.

## Capital Gains Tax Changes

Capital gains tax rates increased with immediate effect:

| Taxpayer | Previous Rate | New Rate |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Basic-rate (most assets) | 10% | 18% |
| Higher-rate (most assets) | 20% | 24% |
| Residential property (basic) | 18% | 18% (unchanged) |
| Residential property (higher) | 24% | 24% (unchanged) |

The annual CGT allowance remains at **£3,000**. These changes mainly affect individuals selling business assets, investments, or shares — for example, if a founder sells their stake in a social venture.

## Business Rates Relief

For social ventures with a retail, hospitality, or leisure trading arm, there's **40% business rates relief** for 2025–26, capped at £110,000 per business. The small business rates multiplier has been frozen.

This is particularly relevant if your social venture runs a shop, cafe, community venue, or similar operation that qualifies.

## Income Tax and Benefits

Income tax and National Insurance thresholds remain **frozen** at current levels through 2028:

- Personal allowance: £12,570
- Higher rate threshold: £50,270

As wages rise with inflation, more people are pulled into higher tax brackets — a process known as "fiscal drag." This affects both you and your employees.

The **State Pension Triple Lock** has been maintained, with pensions rising by 4.1% in 2025–26. Working-age benefits will increase by 1.7% (in line with September 2024 CPI).

## HMRC Compliance and Enforcement

The government has increased HMRC's funding to strengthen compliance and enforcement. Key areas of focus:

- **Supply chain transparency** — more scrutiny of how businesses engage contractors
- **Umbrella companies** — tighter regulations around employment intermediaries
- **Tax avoidance schemes** — continued crackdowns
- **Overdue payments** — increased interest rates on late tax payments

If your social venture uses freelancers or contractors, make sure your arrangements are genuine and properly documented. HMRC is paying closer attention to businesses that may be misclassifying employment relationships.

## What This Means for Your Social Venture

Here's a quick action checklist:

- **Review your payroll costs** — model the impact of higher employer NICs against the increased Employment Allowance
- **Update your budget** — factor in National Living Wage increases if you employ staff at or near minimum wage
- **Check your business rates** — if you have a qualifying premises, apply for the 40% relief
- **Talk to your accountant** — particularly if you're planning to sell assets, restructure, or take on new employees. The combined effect of these changes may shift what's most tax-efficient for your organisation.
