## Getting Started

Setting up a new business means you'll need to navigate a few tax responsibilities. This guide provides a simple breakdown depending on your business structure: sole trader, partnership, CIC (Community Interest Company), or limited company.

## 1. Sole Trader

A sole trader is someone who owns and runs their business on their own.

### Tax Responsibilities

**Income Tax** — you pay income tax on your business profits:

| Band | Rate | Income Range |
|------|------|-------------|
| Personal allowance | 0% | Up to £12,570 |
| Basic rate | 20% | £12,571 – £50,270 |
| Higher rate | 40% | £50,271 – £150,000 |
| Additional rate | 45% | Over £150,000 |

**National Insurance (NI):**

- **Class 2:** Fixed weekly amount if profits exceed £6,725
- **Class 4:** 9% on profits between £9,569 and £50,270, plus 2% on profits over £50,270

**Self-Assessment:** Register as self-employed and file a Self-Assessment tax return annually. The deadline to file online is usually 31st January following the end of the tax year.

### Business Expenses You Can Claim

- **Office space costs** — rent, utilities, and business rates
- **Home office expenses** — a portion of home costs (rent, heating, electricity, internet), typically calculated by dividing bills by the number of rooms
- **Travel** — business-related travel (fuel at 45p per mile, public transport, parking, accommodation)
- **Vehicle repairs** — servicing, MOTs, replacement parts, breakdown cover (if used solely for business)
- **Equipment and tools** — computers, phones, furniture
- **Marketing** — advertising, website costs, promotional materials
- **Professional services** — accountant fees, legal fees, consultancy
- **Staff wages** — if you pay yourself a salary

## 2. Partnership

A partnership is where two or more people run a business together.

### Tax Responsibilities

- **Income Tax:** Each partner pays income tax on their share of the business profits (same rates as sole traders)
- **National Insurance:** Partners pay Class 2 and Class 4 NI if profits exceed certain thresholds
- **Partnership Tax Return:** Submit a partnership tax return (SA800). Each partner also files an individual Self-Assessment for their share of the profits

### Business Expenses You Can Claim

Similar to a sole trader:

- Business premises (rent, utilities, office supplies)
- Travel expenses and vehicle costs
- Staff wages
- Professional fees (accountants, solicitors, consultants)
- Equipment, marketing, and office supplies
- Vehicle repair costs (servicing, MOTs, parts, breakdown cover)

## 3. Community Interest Company (CIC)

A CIC is a special type of limited company aimed at benefiting the community rather than generating profits for shareholders.

### Tax Responsibilities

- **Corporation Tax:** CICs are subject to corporation tax on profits (standard rate 19%, subject to change)
- **VAT:** Register for VAT if turnover exceeds £85,000
- **Annual Accounts:** File annual accounts and a confirmation statement with Companies House, plus a Corporation Tax return with HMRC
- **Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR):** Tax reliefs may be available for investors in CICs

### Business Expenses You Can Claim

- Employee wages
- Office equipment and supplies
- Marketing costs
- Travel and transport
- Professional services
- Research & development costs, if applicable

## 4. Limited Company

A limited company is a separate legal entity from its owners (shareholders), providing protection from personal liability.

### Tax Responsibilities

- **Corporation Tax:** Paid on profits (rate of 19%, subject to change depending on profit levels)
- **VAT:** Register if turnover exceeds £85,000
- **Paying Yourself:**
  - **Salary** — subject to income tax and NI contributions
  - **Dividends** — taxed separately at lower rates: 8.75% (basic), 33.75% (higher), 39.35% (additional)
- **Payroll and PAYE:** If you employ staff or pay yourself a salary, operate PAYE to deduct income tax and NI
- **Corporation Tax Return:** File annually and submit company accounts to Companies House

### Business Expenses You Can Claim

- Salaries and wages (including directors)
- Office equipment and software
- Travel expenses (mileage, flights, hotels)
- Advertising and marketing costs
- Professional services (accounting, legal)
- Insurance (public liability, professional indemnity)
- R&D costs (enhanced tax relief may be available)

## General Tips for All Business Types

1. **Keep Accurate Records** — maintain good records of income, expenses, and business activities
2. **Understand VAT** — if VAT-registered, track VAT on sales and purchases and pay any VAT due to HMRC
3. **Plan for Tax Deadlines** — missed deadlines can lead to fines and interest charges
4. **Consider Hiring an Accountant** — an accountant can help manage filings, claim deductions, and ensure compliance. HMRC provides free payroll software (HMRC Basic Tools), and packages like Sage and QuickBooks are also available.
