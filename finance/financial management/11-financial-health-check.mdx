## How to Use This Checklist

This checklist brings together the key financial management questions every social venture should be able to answer. Work through it honestly — mark each item as **Yes**, **No**, or **Partial**, and note any actions you need to take.

Revisit it **quarterly** to track your progress and catch issues early. It's also a useful tool to prepare for funder due diligence, board reviews, or conversations with your accountant.

## Accounting Records and Systems

- Are your books of account up to date, reconciled, and in good order?
- Are supporting documents (receipts, invoices, contracts) filed and complete?
- Could someone follow a complete transaction from start to finish through your records?
- Is your Chart of Accounts up to date, clear, and available to everyone who needs it?
- Are you using electronic payments for most transactions? *(If you're still largely cash-based, consider why — and whether this creates risk)*
- Do you have an electronic accounting system in place? *(e.g. Xero, QuickBooks — see [Setting Up Your Books](/finance/financial management/02-setting-up-your-books))*
- Do you have an external accountant with a close working relationship? *(See [Choosing an Accountant](/finance/financial management/08-choosing-an-accountant))*
- Can you produce key documents on request — profit and loss statements, invoices, bank statements?
- Do you have a process for issuing invoices and making payments?
- Do you have financial controls in place — such as following up overdue invoices and an expenses policy?

## Financial Reporting

- Is income broadly in line with expenditure, or tracking as planned?
- Is there enough cash available to pay off immediate debts? *(Consider your liquidity position)*
- Do you produce management accounts? If so, how often — monthly, quarterly, or annually?
- Who reviews your management accounts — the board, senior team, or just the founder?
- How long ago was your last external audit conducted?
- What was the auditor's opinion? If it was qualified, what action have you taken?
- Do your end-of-year accounts go beyond the minimum — does your accountant make recommendations when compiling them?

## Budgets and Forecasting

- Do you have a budget in place for the current year? What about next year?
- Does your budget include forecasts for cash flow and reserves?
- Is your budget based on actual past income and expenditure data?
- Can your budget template be easily adapted to create different scenarios — best case, worst case, realistic?
- Who is involved in your budgeting process — just the founder, the senior team, or the board too?
- Are budget reports circulated regularly and promptly to the people who need them?
- Do managers and budget holders receive appropriate reports?
- Is actual income and expenditure broadly in line with the budget?
- Are there any unusual variances? Are they properly explained?
- Are linked budget items behaving consistently? *(e.g. if staff costs rise, have related NI and pension costs risen too?)*
- Do the financial figures match your narrative progress reports? *(Your numbers and your story to funders should tell the same tale)*

## Internal Controls and Fraud Prevention

Strong internal controls protect your social venture from errors and fraud. Even small organisations need basic safeguards.

- Is there adequate **separation of duties** in practice? *(Different people should raise and pay purchase orders, approve expenses, and reconcile bank statements)*
- Is there one supplier who suddenly seems to be used more often than others? *(This can indicate a conflict of interest)*
- Check your **assets register** — is all equipment listed and where it's supposed to be?
- Are your policies up to date? *(Insurance, sign-off authority, payment deadlines, expenses)*
- Do you have a process to set aside funds for end-of-year tax liabilities?
- Complete a spot check on cash — are there any IOUs or unexplained shortages?
- Complete a spot check on salary records — look for "ghost workers" and confirm that tax has been paid to HMRC
- Are the safe, stockroom, and cash box keys kept secure at all times?

**Behavioural warning signs to watch for:**

- Does anyone display unexplained lifestyle changes — new spending patterns, a new car, or signs of personal financial stress?
- Is there someone who is always first in and last out, and never takes holidays? *(This can indicate someone who doesn't want others looking at their work)*

These aren't accusations — they're patterns that experienced auditors look for. Being aware of them protects everyone.

## Tax and Regulatory Compliance

- Are you registered with the HMRC Government Gateway?
- Is the company registered for Corporation Tax and paying it?
- Is the company VAT-registered (if required) and filing returns on time? *(See [VAT Essentials](/finance/financial management/04-vat-essentials))*
- Are you paying PAYE appropriately for all employees?
- Have you met all reporting requirements for Companies House — annual accounts and confirmation statements?
- Are the correct shareholder or member arrangements in place and documented?
- Do you have employer liability insurance and public liability insurance in place?

## Cash Flow Health

- Has the company hit any cash flow problems in the past 12 months?
- Will the company hit any cash flow problems in the next 12 months?
- Is the company in need of investment or additional working capital?
- Does the company struggle with budgeting or managing seasonal income?
- Does the company manage its income effectively? *(Short payment terms on invoices, deposits on large works, contracts in place — see [Invoicing and Getting Paid](/finance/financial management/06-invoicing-and-getting-paid))*
- Does the company manage its outgoings effectively? *(Payments made on time to suppliers, no unnecessary late-payment penalties)*
- Does the company hold appropriate levels of stock? *(Neither too much cash tied up in inventory nor too little to fulfil orders)*
- Does the company have reserves of at least **two months' operating costs**?
- Does the company rely on **multiple sources of income**? *(Aim for 10 or more clients or income streams)*
- Does any single contract make up **more than 50% of income**? *(If so, what's your plan if you lose it?)*
- If the company has taken on a loan, is the **debt coverage ratio greater than 1.15**? *(Projected operating income ÷ future debt repayments — calculate quarterly. See [Cash Flow and Budgeting](/finance/financial management/07-cash-flow-and-budgeting))*

## Insurance and Risk

- Do you have **employer's liability insurance**? *(Legally required if you have employees)*
- Do you have **public liability insurance**? *(Essential if members of the public visit your premises or interact with your services)*
- Do you have **professional indemnity insurance**? *(Important if you provide advice or professional services)*
- Is your insurance reviewed annually and are policies current?
- Do you have a **risk register** that's reviewed regularly?

## Next Steps

No social venture will score a perfect "Yes" on every item — especially if you're early-stage. The value is in identifying the gaps and prioritising what to fix.
