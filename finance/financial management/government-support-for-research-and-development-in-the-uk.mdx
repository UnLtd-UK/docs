## Introduction

The UK Government, and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have a strategy to stimulate business research and development (R&D) and encourage innovative firms to contribute to economic growth. There is a range of financial support available to help UK firms that have the potential to undertake world-class innovation and R&D.

## UK-Wide Support

### Innovate UK Funding Competitions

Innovate UK runs funding competitions providing **£25,000 to £10 million** for R&D projects. The funding can be used to:

The **Open Funding Programme** provides funding to help innovative businesses with high-growth potential to test and develop an innovative idea, process, product or service.

### Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs)

KTPs help UK firms improve competitiveness, productivity and performance by accessing knowledge and expertise within UK universities and colleges.

- A KTP is formed between a company and an academic institution ("Knowledge Base" partner)
