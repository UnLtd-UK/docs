## Model Structure: Inputs, Calculations, Outputs

A well-structured financial model separates three layers:

1. **Inputs** — the assumptions and data you control: growth rates, pricing, headcount, cost escalation rates, grant amounts, and timing. These should be easy to find and change.
2. **Calculations** — the formulas that transform inputs into forecasts: revenue schedules, cost builds, working capital movements, depreciation schedules, and debt repayment tables.
3. **Outputs** — the forecast financial statements and summary dashboards: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, key ratios, and charts.

This separation matters because it makes the model transparent, auditable, and flexible. When a funder asks "what happens if revenue grows at 3% instead of 5%?", you change one input cell and every output updates automatically.

## Setting Up Your Workbook

Before entering any numbers, plan your workbook structure. Use a consistent approach to naming, colour coding, and sheet ordering.

**Colour conventions** (widely used in financial modelling):

| Colour | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Blue font | Hard-coded inputs (numbers you type in) |
| Black font | Formulas (calculated from other cells) |
| Green font | Links to other sheets |
| Yellow shading | Input cells that the user should change |

**Sheet naming:** Use clear, descriptive names. Avoid "Sheet1" or abbreviations that only you understand.

### A Simple Model (3-5 Sheets)

If you are an early-stage social enterprise with a single revenue stream, a simple model is appropriate. The TA SW Example Workbook provides a good template with five sheets:

1. **Instructions** — how to use the model
2. **Income** — revenue forecast by product or service line, broken down monthly
3. **Expenditure** — cost forecast by category (salaries, rent, materials, etc.)
4. **Cash Flow** — monthly cash position showing income minus expenditure, opening and closing balances
5. **Milestones** — key dates and deliverables linked to the financial plan

This structure works well for grant applications, early board reporting, and basic scenario testing.

### A Complex Model (10+ Sheets)

If your organisation has multiple revenue streams, different business lines, or is preparing for social investment, you may need a more detailed model. The UnLtd Financial Model V16 demonstrates this with 39 sheets covering:

- **Key Inputs** — a single sheet where all major assumptions are entered
- **Revenue sheets** — separate schedules for product sales, UK and overseas sales, and sales assumptions
- **Cost sheets** — variable costs, staff costs, central costs, and capital expenditure each on their own sheet
- **Working capital** — accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory calculations
- **Funding** — grant income, existing debt, new debt financing, and equity financing
- **Output sheets** — summary P&L, balance sheet, cash flow, sensitivities, and key ratios
- **Check sheet** — automated error detection

The principle is the same: inputs feed calculations, which feed outputs. The additional sheets simply provide more granularity.

## Revenue Assumptions

Your revenue forecast is the most important — and most uncertain — part of the model. Build it from specific, testable assumptions rather than top-down guesses.

- **Unit pricing** — what do you charge per unit, session, licence, or contract? If pricing varies, create a separate assumption for each price point.
- **Volume** — how many units will you sell each month? Base this on evidence: existing orders, pipeline, market research, or comparable organisations.
- **Grant timing** — when will grant income be received? Model each grant as a separate line with its own start date, duration, and payment schedule.
- **Growth rates** — if you expect volume to increase over time, state the rate explicitly. A 5% monthly growth rate compounds to 80% annual growth — make sure that is realistic.

**Revenue = Price × Volume**, calculated for each product or service line, for each month.

## Expenditure Assumptions

Build your cost forecast from the bottom up, using the cost classifications from the previous page:

- **Salary builds** — list each role with its salary, start date, and any planned pay increases. Include employer National Insurance and pension contributions. This is typically the largest cost for a social enterprise.
- **Rent and premises** — enter the monthly cost and any planned escalation (for example, rent reviews every three years).
- **Variable costs** — link these to volume drivers from your revenue forecast. If each unit sold requires £5 of materials, the formula is straightforward.
- **One-off costs** — equipment purchases, launch costs, or fit-out expenses. Place these in the correct month.

Avoid the temptation to use a single "percentage of revenue" for all costs. While the SGA-to-sales ratio method (for example, overheads at 20% of revenue) is useful for quick estimates, a detailed bottom-up build gives you much better control and credibility with funders.

## Linking Your Statements

Once you have revenue and cost schedules, link them into the three financial statements:

1. **Income statement** — sum revenue lines, deduct cost of sales for gross profit, deduct overheads for operating profit, deduct interest and tax for net profit.
2. **Balance sheet** — populate non-current assets from your CAPEX schedule (net of depreciation), current assets from working capital calculations, liabilities from your debt and payables schedules, and equity from retained earnings.
3. **Cash flow statement** — start with net profit, add back depreciation, adjust for working capital changes, deduct capital expenditure, and add or deduct financing cash flows.

The closing cash balance on the cash flow statement must equal the cash figure on the balance sheet. This is your primary check that the model is internally consistent.

## Error Checking and Balancing

Build error checks into your model from the start:

- **Balance sheet check** — does Assets = Liabilities + Equity? Create a row that calculates the difference; it should always be zero.
- **Cash flow reconciliation** — does the net change in cash equal the difference between opening and closing cash on the balance sheet?
- **Circular reference check** — if your model includes interest calculations that depend on the debt balance, which depends on cash flow, which depends on interest, you have a circular reference. Use Excel's iterative calculation setting or break the circularity with a manual toggle.
- **Negative cash balance** — flag any month where the cash balance goes negative. This indicates a funding gap that needs to be addressed.
- **Sense checks** — are margins within a reasonable range? Does headcount match the salary build? Do growth rates compound to plausible annual figures?

Many experienced modellers create a dedicated "Check" sheet that summarises all error flags in one place, with conditional formatting that turns green when everything balances and red when something is wrong.

## Milestone Tracking

A financial model is more useful when connected to operational milestones. The TA SW Example Workbook includes a milestones sheet that maps key events — partnership agreements, product launches, hiring dates — against the financial timeline.

This serves two purposes:

1. **Credibility** — funders and investors can see that your revenue assumptions are tied to specific actions (for example, revenue from a new product starts only after the launch date).
2. **Monitoring** — as you deliver against the plan, you can track whether milestones are being met on time and adjust the financial forecast accordingly.

Consider adding a milestones row or sheet to your own model, linking key dates to the assumptions that depend on them.
