## Why Cost Classification Matters

Before you build a financial model, you need to understand how your costs behave. Different costs respond differently to changes in activity — some stay the same whether you serve ten people or a hundred, while others scale directly with volume. Getting this classification right determines whether your model produces realistic forecasts or misleading ones.

Cost classification also matters when applying for grant funding. Many funders award grants on a "full cost recovery" basis, meaning you need to demonstrate that you have allocated a fair share of overhead costs to each project or programme. Without a clear approach to cost allocation, you risk under-pricing your services or leaving overhead costs unfunded.

## Fixed vs Variable Costs

### Identifying Your Fixed Costs

Fixed costs are expenses your organisation must cover regardless of how much activity it undertakes. They do not change with sales volume or the number of beneficiaries served. Examples include:

- Office rent and rates
- Permanent staff salaries
- Insurance premiums
- Utility standing charges
- Accounting and legal fees
- Software subscriptions

In a financial model, fixed costs are typically entered as monthly or annual amounts that remain constant across scenarios (unless you deliberately model a step-change, such as moving to a larger office).

### Identifying Your Variable Costs

Variable costs change in direct proportion to activity levels. When you deliver more, these costs rise; when you deliver less, they fall. Examples include:

- Raw materials and supplies
- Freelance or sessional delivery staff paid per session
- Packaging and postage
- Travel expenses linked to service delivery
- Commission or referral fees

In your model, variable costs should be linked to a volume driver — for example, "materials cost per unit sold" multiplied by the number of units in your revenue forecast.

Some costs are **semi-variable** — they have a fixed element plus a variable element. A mobile phone contract with a fixed monthly fee and variable data charges is one example. In modelling, you can split these into their fixed and variable components or treat them as fixed if the variable element is small.

## Direct vs Indirect Costs

A separate but related classification distinguishes direct and indirect costs:

- **Direct costs** (cost of sales) can be attributed to a specific product, service, or project. If you stopped delivering that product, these costs would disappear.
- **Indirect costs** (overheads) support the organisation as a whole and cannot be attributed to a single activity. They would continue even if one project ended.

On the income statement, direct costs are deducted from revenue to give **gross profit**. Indirect costs are then deducted from gross profit to give **operating profit**. This separation helps you understand whether each product or service covers its own direct costs before you consider the overhead burden.

## Allocating Shared Costs

When your social enterprise runs multiple projects or programmes, you need a method for sharing overhead costs fairly between them. This is essential for:

- Grant applications that require full cost recovery
- Understanding the true cost of each programme
- Setting prices that cover both direct and indirect costs
- Avoiding cross-subsidy where one programme inadvertently funds another

The process involves choosing a **cost driver** — a measurable factor that represents how each project consumes overhead resources. Common cost drivers include:

| Overhead type | Possible cost driver |
| --- | --- |
| Office costs (rent, utilities, rates) | Number of FTE staff on each project |
| Finance team time | Number of invoices raised per project |
| Governance costs (board, audit) | Proportion of total expenditure |
| IT costs | Number of users or devices per project |
| Management time | Proportion of staff supervised |

**Worked example:** XYZ Limited is a social enterprise with two grant-funded projects. Total office costs are £34,000 per year. Project A has 4 full-time staff and Project B has 3 full-time and 3 half-time staff (4.5 FTE). That gives 8.5 FTE in total, at a cost of £4,000 per FTE. Project A is allocated £16,000 and Project B is allocated £18,000.

For governance costs of £5,000 per year, XYZ allocates by total expenditure. Project A receives £115,000 in funding (40% of the £285,000 total) and Project B receives £170,000 (60%). So Project A absorbs £2,000 of governance costs and Project B absorbs £3,000.

There is no single correct method — the key is to choose a cost driver that is reasonable, consistent, and defensible to funders.

## Matching Expenses to the Right Period

The matching principle requires you to record expenses in the accounting period they relate to, not the period in which cash is paid. This principle affects how costs appear in your financial model:

- **Accrued expenses** — costs incurred but not yet paid (for example, an accountant's fee for preparing year-end accounts). These are recognised as expenses now and as liabilities on the balance sheet.
- **Prepayments** — costs paid in advance for a future period (for example, an annual insurance premium purchased halfway through the year). Only the portion relating to the current period is expensed; the rest sits as a current asset.

When building your model, ensure that expenses are aligned with the period of activity they support. If you pay quarterly insurance in advance, spread the cost across the three months it covers rather than recording the full amount in the payment month.

## Exercise: Classify Your Own Costs

Take a few minutes to list the main costs your social enterprise incurs. For each one, classify it as:

1. **Fixed or variable** — does it change with your level of activity?
2. **Direct or indirect** — can you attribute it to a specific product, service, or project?

If you run multiple programmes, consider which cost driver you would use to allocate your indirect costs. Is it headcount, expenditure, time, or something else? There is no single right answer, but your choice should reflect how each programme actually consumes overhead resources.
