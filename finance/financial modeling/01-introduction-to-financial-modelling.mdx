## What Is a Financial Model?

A financial model is a spreadsheet that represents your organisation's finances mathematically. It takes a set of assumptions — about revenue, costs, growth rates, and timing — and calculates what your financial position will look like in the future.

At its simplest, a financial model is a structured way of answering the question: *if these assumptions hold, what will our cash position, profit, and balance sheet look like over the next one to five years?*

Financial models are dynamic. When you change an input — say, increasing the price of your main product by 10% — every calculation that depends on price updates automatically. This makes models powerful tools for planning, decision-making, and communicating with funders.

## Why Social Enterprises Need Financial Models

Financial modelling is not just for large corporations. Social enterprises benefit from models in several specific ways:

- **Grant applications** — most funders require a financial forecast as part of the application. A well-structured model demonstrates that you have thought through the numbers and can deliver the proposed programme within budget.
- **Social investment readiness** — if you are seeking repayable finance, investors need to see that your organisation can generate sufficient cash flow to service the investment. A model with scenario analysis builds their confidence.
- **Board reporting** — trustees and directors need to understand the financial trajectory of the organisation. A model that compares forecast performance against actual results supports effective governance.
- **Scenario planning** — what happens if a major grant is delayed? What if demand doubles? A model lets you test these scenarios and prepare contingency plans before they become crises.
- **Budgeting and forecasting** — your annual budget is a financial model for a single year. Extending it over three to five years turns it into a strategic planning tool.

## The Cake Shop Example

To make financial modelling concrete, consider a cake shop and catering company. In a simple model for this business, you would:

1. **Forecast income** — identify different business lines (shop sales, catering contracts), estimate unit prices and volumes for each, and project monthly revenue.
2. **Forecast expenditure** — list costs by category (ingredients, staff salaries, rent, equipment) and estimate monthly amounts, noting which costs are fixed and which vary with sales volume.
3. **Calculate the cash position** — for each month, subtract expenditure from income to get retained earnings. Add the opening cash balance (brought forward from the previous month) to get the closing cash balance (carried forward).

Over time, you can watch the company grow — taking on new employees, offering new products, and expanding into catering. Each change is reflected in the model by adjusting assumptions, and the impact flows through to the bottom line automatically.

This is the essence of financial modelling: structuring assumptions and calculations so that you can see the financial consequences of your plans.

## What This Guide Covers

This guide walks you through everything you need to build and use a financial model for your social enterprise, organised as a ten-page learning journey.

### If You Are New to Accounting

Start from the beginning. Pages 2 to 4 cover the accounting fundamentals you need before building a model — the accounting equation, cost classification, and how to read financial statements. These pages draw on training materials originally developed by UnLtd for social entrepreneurs who are new to finance.

### If You Already Understand Accounts

Skip ahead to page 5, where you will learn how to structure a workbook, set up assumptions, and link the three financial statements into a working model. Pages 6 and 7 cover forecasting, scenario analysis, and business valuation. Page 8 provides walkthroughs of six template models at different levels of complexity. Page 9 indexes 85 hands-on Excel exercises for building advanced modelling skills. Page 10 points you to further resources.
