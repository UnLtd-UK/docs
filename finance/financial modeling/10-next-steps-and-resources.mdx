## Applying What You Have Learned

You now have the foundational knowledge to build and use a financial model for your social enterprise. The most effective way to consolidate your learning is to put it into practice:

1. **Choose a template** from the templates page that matches your current stage and complexity.
2. **Enter your own data** — real assumptions about your revenue, costs, and timing. Even rough estimates are more valuable than a blank template.
3. **Test your model** — change key assumptions and observe how the outputs respond. Does the model behave sensibly? Does the balance sheet balance? Does cash flow reconcile?
4. **Share it** — present your model to a trusted adviser, mentor, or board member. Their questions will reveal gaps in your assumptions and improve your thinking.
5. **Update it regularly** — a model is only useful if it reflects current plans. Review and revise monthly or quarterly, comparing forecasts against actual performance.

## Further Learning Resources

If you want to deepen your understanding of accounting and financial management, the following resources are helpful:

**Online learning:**
- [Accounting Coach](http://www.accountingcoach.com/bookkeeping/explanation) — free lessons on bookkeeping and accounting fundamentals, useful if you want to understand the mechanics behind the financial statements in your model.

**Record keeping:**
- [HMRC: Invoicing and Taking Payment from Customers](https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/invoices-what-they-must-include) — requirements for valid invoices.
- [HMRC: VAT Invoices](https://www.gov.uk/vat-record-keeping/vat-invoices) — additional requirements when VAT registered.

**Tools for financial record keeping:**
- [Xero](https://www.xero.com) — online bookkeeping platform designed for small businesses, with a reputation for being user-friendly.
- Cloud storage services such as Dropbox or Google Drive for keeping copies of invoices, receipts, and financial records.

**Handbook exercises:**
- Work through the Financial Modelling Handbook exercises (indexed on the previous page) to build advanced spreadsheet modelling skills. The exercises progress from basic flags and balances through to complete financial statement models with debt, tax, and refinancing.

## Related Guides

This guide is part of a broader collection of financial resources for social entrepreneurs:

- **Financial Management** — covers budgeting, cash flow management, financial controls, and reporting to boards and funders. If this guide focuses on building the model, the Financial Management guide focuses on using financial information to run your organisation effectively.

## Getting Feedback on Your Model

A financial model is a living document that benefits from review. Consider these sources of feedback:

- **Your accountant** — can check that your assumptions are reasonable and your financial statements are structured correctly.
- **Your board or trustees** — should review the model regularly as part of their governance role. Present the key outputs and scenarios, not the detailed calculations.
- **Your funder or investor** — will have specific requirements for how financial information is presented. Ask early what format and level of detail they expect.
- **Peer social entrepreneurs** — sharing models (with sensitive data removed) can surface blind spots and new ideas.

The goal is not a perfect model — it is a model that is good enough to support better decisions. Start simple, test regularly, and add complexity only when it serves a clear purpose.
