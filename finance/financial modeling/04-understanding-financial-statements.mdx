## The Three Core Statements

Every organisation — whether a charity, community interest company, or social enterprise — reports its finances through three linked statements. Understanding these is essential before you build a financial model, because your model will forecast all three.

The three statements are:

1. **Income statement** (also called the profit and loss account, or P&L) — shows revenue and expenses over a period, ending with net profit or loss.
2. **Balance sheet** (also called the statement of financial position) — shows what the organisation owns, owes, and the residual equity at a single point in time.
3. **Cash flow statement** — tracks cash moving in and out during the period, explaining why your bank balance changed.

Financial accounting produces summary statements for external users (funders, regulators, HMRC) and is legally required. Management accounting produces more detailed, internally focused reports that help you make decisions — including financial models and forecasts.

## The Income Statement (Profit and Loss)

The income statement answers the question: *did we make or lose money this period?*

Its structure follows a logical flow:

| Line | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Revenue** | Total income from trading, grants, contracts, and donations |
| **Less: Cost of sales** | Direct costs of delivering your product or service |
| **= Gross profit** | Revenue minus cost of sales |
| **Less: Overheads** | Indirect costs of running the organisation (rent, salaries, utilities, marketing) |
| **= Operating profit** | Gross profit minus overheads |
| **Less: Interest and tax** | Financing costs and corporation tax |
| **= Net profit (or loss)** | The bottom line |

### Reading a P&L for a Social Enterprise

When reading an income statement for a social enterprise, pay attention to:

- **Revenue mix** — how much comes from trading versus grants? Grant income may be time-limited, which affects your forecasts.
- **Gross profit margin** — what percentage of revenue remains after direct costs? This tells you whether your pricing covers production.
- **Operating profit** — are overheads sustainable relative to gross profit? A negative operating profit means the organisation is spending more on running costs than it earns after direct costs.
- **Cost of sales versus overheads** — cost of sales are direct costs that vary with activity (materials, freelance delivery staff). Overheads are indirect costs that continue regardless of activity (office rent, permanent salaries).

The income statement uses accruals accounting, which means transactions are recorded when they occur, not when cash changes hands. If you invoice a customer in December but they pay in January, the income appears in December's accounts. This distinction between revenue recognition and cash receipt is why you also need a cash flow statement.

## The Balance Sheet

The balance sheet is a snapshot of your organisation's financial position at a specific date. It is built on the accounting equation:

**Assets = Liabilities + Capital (Equity)**

Or rearranged: **Assets − Liabilities = Capital**

**Assets** are things the organisation owns or is owed:
- **Current assets** (lifespan under one year): cash, unpaid customer invoices (trade debtors), stock, prepayments
- **Non-current assets** (lifespan over one year): property, equipment, vehicles, computers

**Liabilities** are things the organisation owes to others:
- **Current liabilities** (due within one year): unpaid supplier invoices (trade creditors), accrued expenses, short-term loans
- **Non-current liabilities** (due after one year): long-term loans, mortgages

**Capital / equity** is the residual interest — what belongs to the owners or, for a charity, what is held to pursue the social mission. It includes any money invested by shareholders plus accumulated profits (retained earnings).

### What the Balance Sheet Tells You

- **Liquidity** — can the organisation pay its bills? Compare current assets to current liabilities.
- **Solvency** — can it meet long-term obligations? Compare total assets to total liabilities.
- **Asset base** — does the organisation own significant property or equipment that could serve as security for loans?
- **Working capital** — current assets minus current liabilities. A positive figure means the organisation can cover short-term obligations.

## The Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement tracks the actual movement of money. It is divided into three sections:

1. **Operating activities** — cash from day-to-day business: receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and employees. Adjustments are made for non-cash items like depreciation and changes in working capital (receivables, payables, inventory).
2. **Investing activities** — cash spent on or received from long-term assets: buying equipment, selling property, or making investments.
3. **Financing activities** — cash from transactions with funders and lenders: taking out loans, repaying debt, issuing shares, receiving equity investment, or paying dividends.

The sum of all three sections gives you the **net cash flow** for the period — the total change in your bank balance.

### Cash Flow vs Profit

A social enterprise can be profitable on paper but still run out of cash. Common reasons include:

- **Timing mismatches** — you record revenue when you invoice, but cash arrives 30 or 60 days later. If you are growing quickly, the gap between invoicing and receiving payment widens.
- **Capital expenditure** — buying equipment is a cash outflow, but the cost appears on the income statement gradually through depreciation, not all at once.
- **Working capital demands** — rapid growth ties up cash in stock and debtors before customer payments catch up.
- **Grant timing** — grant income may be recognised in the accounts before the cash is actually received.

This is why funders and investors look closely at cash flow forecasts alongside the P&L. A positive net cash flow means the organisation generated more cash than it used. A negative net cash flow means it used more than it generated — which is sustainable only if reserves or new funding cover the shortfall.

## How the Three Statements Link Together

The three statements are interconnected, and in a well-built financial model they reconcile automatically:

- **Net profit** from the income statement flows into retained earnings on the balance sheet and serves as the starting point for operating cash flow.
- **Depreciation** is an expense on the income statement that reduces the value of assets on the balance sheet, but because it is not a cash outflow, it is added back in the cash flow statement.
- **Changes in working capital** (debtors, creditors, stock) bridge the gap between accruals-based profit and actual cash movement.
- **Capital expenditure** appears as an investing cash flow and simultaneously increases non-current assets on the balance sheet.
- **Loan drawdowns and repayments** appear in financing cash flow and change the liabilities on the balance sheet.

When you verify that the cash flow statement's closing balance matches the cash figure on the balance sheet, and that the balance sheet balances (assets = liabilities + equity), you know your model is internally consistent. This cross-checking process is called **articulation** and is one of the most important quality checks in financial modelling.

## Building Statements in a Spreadsheet

When you move from reading financial statements to building them in a spreadsheet, you shift from consumer to creator. Your financial model will forecast all three statements, linked together so that a change in one assumption — say, a 10 per cent increase in revenue — ripples through every statement automatically.
