## From Budget to Forecast

A budget is a plan for a single period — typically a year — that sets targets for revenue and spending. A forecast extends beyond a single period and is updated regularly as new information becomes available. Your financial model should be capable of both: setting the initial budget and then revising the forecast as reality unfolds.

The key difference is that a forecast acknowledges uncertainty. Rather than committing to a single set of numbers, you build in the ability to test different assumptions and see how outcomes change.

## Revenue Forecasting Methods

Revenue is the hardest line to forecast because it depends on external factors — customer demand, market conditions, funder decisions — that you do not fully control. Two broad approaches can help.

### For Trading Social Enterprises

If you generate income from selling products or services, use a **bottom-up** approach:

1. Identify each product or service line.
2. Estimate the unit price and the number of units you expect to sell each month.
3. Build in growth assumptions — but ground them in evidence (sales pipeline, marketing plans, comparable businesses).
4. Consider seasonality — many social enterprises see demand fluctuate through the year.

Cross-check your bottom-up forecast with a **top-down** view: what is the total addressable market, and what share can you realistically capture? If your bottom-up forecast implies a market share that seems implausible, revisit your assumptions.

When dealing with an uncertain future market, many modellers use both top-down and bottom-up methods to increase confidence in the forecast.

### For Grant-Dependent Organisations

If grants form a significant part of your income:

1. List each grant separately with its value, start date, end date, and payment schedule.
2. Distinguish between confirmed grants (contracts signed) and pipeline grants (applications submitted or planned).
3. Apply a probability weighting to pipeline grants — for example, 50% likelihood for grants at application stage, 80% for those at interview stage.
4. Model the gap between grant income and total costs to identify the trading revenue needed to become sustainable.

## Cost Forecasting

Cost forecasting is generally more reliable than revenue forecasting because you have greater control over your own spending. The main methods are:

- **Bottom-up build** — for new organisations or new cost lines, calculate each cost from scratch (as described in the previous page).
- **Percentage-of-sales** — for established organisations, express operating expenses as a percentage of revenue based on historical ratios. For example, if overheads have consistently been 20% of revenue, apply that ratio to your revenue forecast to estimate future overheads.
- **Regression analysis** — for organisations with several years of data, statistical analysis can identify the relationship between costs and activity levels, providing a more rigorous basis for forecasting.

For fixed costs, forecast the known amounts and escalate them annually (for example, 3% per year for inflation). For variable costs, link them to the volume drivers in your revenue forecast.

## Scenario Planning

No forecast will be exactly right. Scenario planning helps you prepare for different futures by modelling multiple versions of your assumptions.

### Building a Scenario Switch

Create three scenarios in your model:

| Scenario | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Base case** | Your best estimate of what will happen, grounded in evidence and reasonable assumptions |
| **Upside case** | What happens if things go better than expected — higher demand, faster growth, lower costs |
| **Downside case** | What happens if things go worse — slower sales, delayed grants, higher costs, key staff departure |

The most efficient way to implement scenarios is through a single switch cell. Set up a cell where you enter 1 (base), 2 (upside), or 3 (downside), and use IF or CHOOSE formulas to pull the corresponding assumptions into your calculations. This lets you flip between scenarios instantly.

### What Funders Want to See

Social investors and grant funders typically want to see at least two scenarios:

1. **Base case** — demonstrating that the plan is viable under normal conditions.
2. **Downside case** — demonstrating that the organisation can survive adverse conditions. Key questions they ask: At what point does cash run out? What is the minimum revenue needed to cover costs (break-even)? What contingency plans exist?

Presenting scenarios proactively shows financial sophistication and builds confidence that you have thought through the risks.

## Sensitivity Analysis

While scenario planning changes multiple assumptions at once, sensitivity analysis isolates the impact of changing a single variable. This helps you identify which assumptions matter most.

Common sensitivity tests for a social enterprise model:

- What if revenue is 10% or 20% below forecast?
- What if a major grant is delayed by three months?
- What if salary costs increase by 5% due to recruitment difficulties?
- What if customer payment terms extend from 30 to 60 days?

You can present sensitivity results in a table or a tornado diagram showing which variables have the greatest impact on your key outputs (cash balance, net profit, or break-even point). The UnLtd Financial Model V16 includes a dedicated sensitivities sheet for this purpose.

## Presenting Your Forecast

When presenting your forecast to a board, funder, or investor:

- **Lead with the summary** — key metrics on a single page: revenue, costs, net profit, cash position, and headcount by year.
- **Show your assumptions** — make the inputs visible and clearly labelled. Funders want to challenge them, not just see the outputs.
- **Include scenarios** — at minimum, show base and downside cases.
- **Highlight risks and mitigations** — identify the biggest uncertainties and explain what you would do if they materialise.
- **Use charts sparingly** — a revenue trend line, a cash flow waterfall, and a break-even chart are usually sufficient. Avoid cluttering dashboards with too many visualisations.
- **Update regularly** — a forecast that is twelve months old is not a forecast, it is a historical artefact. Review and update monthly or quarterly, comparing actual performance against the plan.
