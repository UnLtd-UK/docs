## The Accounting Equation

The accounting equation is the foundation of all financial record-keeping. It states that everything a business owns must be financed either by what it owes to outsiders or by what belongs to its owners:

**Assets = Liabilities + Capital**

Or equivalently: **Assets − Liabilities = Capital**

- **Assets** are things a business owns — cash, equipment, property, unpaid customer invoices.
- **Liabilities** are things a business owes to outsiders — supplier bills, loans, tax obligations.
- **Capital** (also called equity or shareholders' funds) is what the owners hold — their original investment plus any retained profits.

This equation must always balance. Every financial transaction affects at least two elements. For example, when a social enterprise buys a computer for £1,000 with cash, one asset (cash) decreases by £1,000 and another asset (equipment) increases by £1,000. The equation stays balanced.

When a business earns a profit, that profit increases capital. When it makes a loss, capital decreases. This is why income and expenditure ultimately sit within the capital side of the equation — the profit and loss account is a detailed breakdown of changes to capital during the period.

## Assets, Liabilities, and Capital

Understanding these three categories is essential for reading financial statements and building a financial model. Every financial event falls into one of them.

### Current vs Non-Current Assets

**Current assets** have a lifespan of less than one year and are expected to be converted to cash or used up within the normal operating cycle:

- Cash in the bank
- Trade debtors (unpaid customer invoices)
- Stock or inventory
- Prepayments (expenses paid in advance, such as insurance)

**Non-current assets** (also called fixed assets) have a lifespan of more than one year:

- Land and buildings
- Equipment and machinery
- Vehicles
- Computers and technology

### Current vs Non-Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities** are obligations due within one year:

- Trade creditors (unpaid supplier invoices)
- Accrued expenses (costs incurred but not yet invoiced)
- Short-term loans and overdrafts
- Tax payable

**Non-current liabilities** are obligations due after one year:

- Long-term bank loans
- Mortgages
- Deferred grant income (where conditions have not yet been met)

## Accruals and Prepayments

Financial statements use accruals accounting rather than cash accounting. Under cash accounting, you record transactions when money changes hands. Under accruals accounting, you record transactions when they occur, regardless of when cash is paid or received. This gives a more accurate picture of financial performance.

### Accrued Expenses

An accrued expense is a cost you have incurred but not yet paid for. For example, if your social enterprise uses an accountant to prepare year-end accounts, the work happens during the accounting period but the invoice arrives afterwards. Under accruals accounting, you still recognise the expense in the period it relates to.

The accrued amount appears as:
- An **expense** on the income statement (reducing profit)
- A **current liability** on the balance sheet (the organisation owes the money)

### Prepayments

A prepayment is the opposite — you pay for something in advance of using it. For example, if you buy a 12-month insurance policy halfway through your financial year, only six months of cost relate to the current period. The remaining six months are a prepayment.

The prepaid amount appears as:
- A **current asset** on the balance sheet (the organisation has paid for something it has not yet used)

Only the portion that relates to the current period appears as an expense on the income statement.

## Depreciation

When a social enterprise buys a non-current asset — say a computer costing £1,000 with an expected useful life of five years — the full cost is not charged as an expense in the year of purchase. Instead, the cost is spread over the asset's useful life through depreciation.

**Straight-line depreciation** divides the cost evenly across the useful life. The £1,000 computer would be depreciated at £200 per year for five years.

**Reducing-balance depreciation** charges a fixed percentage of the remaining book value each year. This results in higher charges in early years and lower charges later, which may better reflect how some assets lose value.

Each year, the depreciation charge appears as:
- An **expense** on the income statement
- A **reduction** in the asset's value on the balance sheet

Depreciation is a non-cash expense — no money leaves the bank account when you record it. This is important when building financial models because depreciation affects profit but does not affect cash flow directly. It is added back in the cash flow statement.

Not all assets are depreciated. Land typically does not depreciate. Only assets that are "material" (significant in value) need formal depreciation calculations.

## Double-Entry Bookkeeping in Brief

The accounting equation is maintained through double-entry bookkeeping, where every transaction is recorded with at least two entries — a debit and a credit — that keep the equation in balance. You do not need to master bookkeeping to build a financial model, but understanding the principle helps you see why changes in one part of your model must be reflected elsewhere.

For example, when a customer pays an invoice:
- Cash (asset) increases — debit
- Trade debtors (asset) decreases — credit

The balance sheet stays balanced, and no entry appears on the income statement because the revenue was already recognised when the invoice was raised.

## Test Your Understanding

Use this quick self-check to confirm you have grasped the key concepts. Classify each item as an **Asset (A)**, **Liability (L)**, or **Capital (C)**:

| Item | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Cash in the company bank account | A |
| Office furniture | A |
| Unpaid bills from suppliers | L |
| Money invested by shareholders | C |
| Profits from trading | C |
| Paying rent on office space | C (past expenditure reduces capital) |
| Bank overdraft | L |
| Unpaid invoices from customers | A |
| Wages paid to employees | C (past expenditure reduces capital) |

The items marked as capital may feel counterintuitive. Remember: anything that flows through the income statement — revenue and expenses — ultimately affects capital. Past expenditure on rent and wages has already reduced profits and therefore reduced the capital the owners hold. If you find this concept unfamiliar, revisit the accounting equation and trace through a few examples.
