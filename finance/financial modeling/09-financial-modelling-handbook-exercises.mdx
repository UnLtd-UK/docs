## How to Use These Exercises

The Financial Modelling Handbook Files folder contains 85 Excel exercise files (66 .xlsx and 19 .xlsb) designed to build your spreadsheet modelling skills progressively. They accompany a structured financial modelling handbook and are organised by chapter.

Most exercises come in a **BEG/END pair**:

- **BEG** (beginning) — the starting point file. Open this, follow the handbook instructions, and build the solution yourself.
- **END** (end) — the completed solution. Use this to check your work or to study the technique if you get stuck.

Some files are standalone (marked with just a version number) and serve as reference models or starting templates.

The exercises progress from simple foundations (flags, balances, and basic techniques) through core modelling skills to a complete financial statement model build including revenue, costs, fixed assets, debt, tax, and advanced topics like refinancing and revolving credit.

## Chapter 2: Foundations

### Getting Started

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `2.33 FMH Start v01f.xlsx` | Starter workbook for the handbook exercises |
| `2.9 FMH blocks BEG 01a.xlsx` | Building blocks exercise — starting point |
| `2.9 FMH PH BEG 01a.xlsx` | Placeholder exercise — starting point |

### Blocks, Flags, and Balances

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `2.13 FMH Flags END 01a.xlsx` | Flags exercise — completed solution |
| `2.14 FMH 5 types of flags 01a.xlsx` | Reference: five types of flags used in financial models |

Flags are binary indicators (0 or 1) used to turn calculations on and off at specific time periods. Balances track cumulative values over time. These are fundamental building blocks that appear throughout every financial model.
