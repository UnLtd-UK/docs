## Choosing the Right Template

The right template depends on where your social enterprise is in its journey and how complex your finances are. Below we describe six templates included in this collection, grouped by stage.

### Early Stage (Pre-Revenue)

If you are just starting out, you need a simple model that helps you understand your costs and plan your first year of cash flow. Start with the **Cash Flow Forecast and Actual Template** — it is the most straightforward and lets you compare your plan against actual results month by month.

### Growing (Trading and Grants)

Once you are generating income from one or two sources, you need a model that separates income streams, tracks expenditure by category, and shows your cash position over time. The **Blaze Trails Financial Model**, **Example Financial Model**, and **TA SW Example Workbook** are all suitable at this stage.

### Established (Multiple Revenue Streams)

If your organisation has multiple business lines, is seeking social investment, or needs to report to multiple funders, you need a more sophisticated model with separate sheets for each revenue stream, detailed cost builds, and full financial statements. The **Example Financial Model v2** and the **UnLtd Financial Model V16** provide this level of detail.

## Cash Flow Forecast and Actual Template

**Source file:** `Copy of Cash_Flow_Forecast and Actual_Template.xls`

This is the simplest template in the collection — a two-sheet workbook designed for organisations that need to forecast and then track cash flow on a monthly basis.

**What it contains:**
- A forecast sheet where you enter expected income and expenditure by month
- An actuals sheet where you record what actually happened, enabling variance analysis

**When to use it:** At the very start of your journey, when you need to understand whether you have enough cash to cover your costs each month. Also useful as a companion to a more detailed model, providing a simple view for trustees or non-financial board members.

## Blaze Trails Financial Model

**Source file:** `Blaze Trails Financial Model.xlsx`

A four-sheet workbook designed for a small trading social enterprise.

**What it contains:**
- Income and expenditure forecast
- Cash flow summary
- Supporting assumptions

**When to use it:** When you have a single product or service line and want a clean, easy-to-follow model. The structure is transparent enough that someone unfamiliar with financial modelling can follow the logic.

## Example Financial Model

**Source file:** `Example Financial Model.xlsx`

A more detailed template with nine sheets, providing a fuller picture of the organisation's finances.

**What it contains:**
- Separate sheets for revenue, costs, and cash flow
- Supporting schedules for assumptions
- Summary output sheet

**When to use it:** When you need to present a more structured model to a funder or investor but do not yet need the complexity of a multi-business-line model.

## Example Financial Model v2

**Source file:** `Example Financial Model v2.xlsx`

An enhanced version of the Example Financial Model with eight sheets covering three years of forecasts.

**What it contains:**
- **Year 1, Year 2, Year 3** — separate annual sheets with monthly breakdowns of income and expenditure
- **Summary** — a consolidated view across all three years
- **Unit Pricing** — a dedicated sheet for pricing assumptions

**When to use it:** When you need a three-year forecast for a grant application or business plan. The unit pricing sheet is particularly useful if you offer multiple products or services at different price points, as it keeps pricing assumptions separate from the volume forecast.

## TA SW Example Workbook

**Source file:** `TA SW Example Workbook.xlsx`

A five-sheet workbook originally designed for the Transform Ageing programme in the South West, but applicable to any social enterprise.

**What it contains:**
- **Instructions** — guidance on how to use the model
- **Income** — revenue forecast with unit pricing for up to six income streams, broken down monthly over three years
- **Expenditure** — cost forecast by category (salaries, outgoings) over the same period
- **Cash Flow** — monthly cash position derived from the income and expenditure sheets
- **Project Milestones** — a timeline of key deliverables mapped against the financial forecast

**When to use it:** When you want to link your financial plan to operational milestones. The milestones sheet is valuable for programme-funded work where deliverables are tied to payment schedules. The three-year monthly view provides the granularity that most funders expect.

## UnLtd Financial Model V16

**Source file:** `UnLtd Financial Model V16 - 3 lines of business.xlsx`

The most comprehensive template in the collection, with 39 sheets designed for organisations with multiple business lines seeking social investment.

**What it contains:**
- **Key Inputs** — a single sheet where all major assumptions are entered, with progress tracking (started/completed)
- **Disclaimer** — standard caveats for financial projections
- **Output sheets** — Summary, P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Sensitivities, and Key Ratios
- **Revenue sheets** — Product Sales, Sales Assumptions, UK Sales, Overseas Sales, and a consolidated Revenue sheet
- **Work sheets (1-9)** — detailed calculation sheets for different components of the model
- **Cost sheets** — Variable Costs, Staff Costs, Central Costs, Working Capital, and CAPEX
- **Funding sheets** — Grant Income, Existing Debt, Equity Financing, and Debt Financing
- **Other sheets** — Tax, Dividends, Other Income, and a Check sheet for error detection

**When to use it:** When your social enterprise has multiple revenue streams (the model supports three business lines), when you are preparing for social investment, or when you need a full set of financial statements with sensitivity analysis. The Check sheet is particularly valuable — it flags errors automatically so you can spot problems before sharing the model with investors.

**Tips for using this template:**
1. Start with the Key Inputs sheet and work through each assumption systematically.
2. Do not modify the formula sheets (Outputs, Ratios, Check) until you understand how they are linked.
3. Use the Sensitivities sheet to stress-test your assumptions before presenting to investors.
4. Review the Check sheet after every change — a zero balance confirms internal consistency.
