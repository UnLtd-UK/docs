## Board Recruitment Policy

# Board Recruitment Policy
# For company name

**Date policy agreed:**
**Date policy to be reviewed:**
## Introduction
An effective board is essential to supporting the growth of THE COMPANY . We are committed to have good governance and the right board in place to achieve this. Furthermore, we are committed to seeking out the most appropriate board members to achieve balance and diversity of thought on the board.
## Planning the recruitment
Every year, the board will decide whether they need to actively recruit new board members. In addition, if during the course of the year, any board members announce their intention to leave, the board will decide whether they need to recruit new board members in the place.
The Board will follow the Company Articles, Shareholders Agreement and policies to determine the correct process for recruitment and electing or co-opting new board members.
The Board will agree on one board member to lead the recruitment process. This board member will make sure the recruitment is kept on the board’s agenda, that progress is made, and that this policy is reviewed after the recruitment. Action and responsibilities may be delegated to other board members.
## Creating a board pack
The board will approve the creation of a series of documents for recruiting new members. These documents fall into 3 stages:
- Assessing the requirements for new board members
- Job Pack for advertising the role
- Directors’ Pack for induction of new members
The board member responsible for recruitment will lead the Board in assessing the requirements for new board members with a Skills Audit which is reviewed against the Business Plan and company aims for the next 2 years.
The following key components will be included in the Job Pack for recruitment of new members:
- Advertisement
- Short introduction to the company and its medium term aims
- Job Description including key competencies
- A summary of the Recruitment and Induction Process
The following are key components of the Directors’ Pack which is preferably provided through online access to a board intranet:
- NED Service Agreement
- Business Plan
- Company Policies
- Board Policies
- Copies previous agendas and minutes of board meetings.
## Advertising the roles
In order to seek out diverse members for an effective board, the company will promote the roles in the following media:
- Company website and social media
- Networks the company has access to including
- Individual board members’ networks both online and offline
- Specialist publications if appropriate to the role and should the board consider it necessary.
## Selecting the best people
The recruitment process for selecting the best people has been developed as follows for 2019:
- Open recruitment on 27th Feb and close it on 18th April.
- Candidates are asked to submit an application by completing drafting a letter detailing why they wish to be a director of the Company and attaching their CV.
- One board member (NAMED) manages the applications and confirms receipt by email to applicants.
- One board member (Karen Leigh Anderson) reviews the applications and screens them against the job pack. A summary document is then provided for the board with recommendations for proceeding with the recruitment process where candidates who meet the criteria and those who do not meet the criteria are identified.
- The board approves a short list for interview on 25th April.
- The board member (NAMED) responsible for recruitment contacts candidates and confirms they wish to be interviewed notifying them of their interview dates by 26th April.
- Candidates are invited to a interview with 3 board members in Cambridge – on 10th and 14th  May.
- The interview panel recommends the new board members to the board, who notifies the successful candidates on 15th May and they are issued with the NED Service Agreement
- An induction board meeting is held for 23rd May for the new board members where they are first appointed to the board as outlined in the governing documents and then receive inductions as follows:
- Company current business plan and key projects.
- Company growth and diversification.
- Company and board policies and procedures
- The board (NAMED) who lead the process shall coordinate thank you cards or emails to everyone who has expressed an interest in the vacancy whether or not they were successful by 17th May.
- Board away day 28th June for Company managers, Executive team and the board where the agenda is as follows:
- Strengths session
- More detailed business planning and strategy discussions.
- Board members notified of planned board meetings as follows:
- Skype board meeting week 29th July
- Cambridge board meeting week 16th September
- Skype board meeting mid October

## Review and development
The Board will review the board recruitment process after each appointment. The new board member should be encouraged to feed in what they felt went well and what could be improved in their view. This review should be conducted by the board member responsible for the process and recorded in the board papers.
If any changes to this policy are needed, the changes shall be made and a revised policy put to the board for adoption. This policy shall be reviewed after each board member is successfully appointed.

**Register of Interests of ****Director****s**






**Version Control:**

**Conflict of Interest Policy**

*Conflicts of interest are **unevitable** and should not be a problem if correctly and sensitively handled. However undeclared or improperly handled, they can cause problems within **an organisation** and can result in the probity of the **organisation** being questioned.*
**Policy**
This policy applies to directors. Directors have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of company and in accordance with company’s governing documents and to avoid situations where there may be a potential conflict of interest. 
Conflicts of interests may arise where an individual’s personal or family interests and/or loyalties conflict with those of the company. Such conflicts may create problems; they can:
- inhibit free discussion
- result in decisions or actions that are not in the interests of the company
- risk the impression that the company has acted improperly.
The aim of this policy is to protect both the organisation and the individuals involved from any appearance of impropriety.
**The declaration of interests**
Accordingly, we are asking directors to declare their interest, and any gifts or hospitality offered and received in connection with their role in the company. A declaration of interests form is provided for this purpose, listing the types of interest you should declare.
To be effective the declaration of interests needs to be updated at least annually, and when any material or specific changes occur.
If you are not sure what to declare, or whether/when your declaration needs to be updated, please err on the side of caution. If you would like to discuss this issue, please contact the Chairperson for confidential guidance.
Interests will be recorded in the company’sregister of interests, which will be maintained by the company. The register will only be accessible by directors

.
**Data Protection**
The information provided will be processed in accordance with the data protection principles as set out in the Data Protection Act 2018. Data will be processed only to ensure that directors act in the best interests of Cthe company The information provided will not be used for any other purpose.
**What to do if you face a conflict of interest**
If you believe you have a perceived or real conflict of interest you should:
- declare the interest at the earliest opportunity
- withdraw form the discussions and decisions relating to the conflict.
If you fail to declare an interest that is known, a company director will declare that interest.
Any minutes relating to the item presenting a conflict should be suitably redacted for the person facing the conflict. A balance needs to be made to ensure that the person still receives sufficient information about the activities of the company generally without disclosing such sensitive information that could place the individual in an untenable position.
**Decisions taken where a ****director**** has an interest**
In the event of the Board having to decide upon a question in which a director has an interest, all decisions will be made by vote, with a simple majority. A quorum must be present for the discussion and decision; interested parties will not be counted when deciding whether the meeting is quorate. Interested Board members may not vote on matters affecting their own interests.
All decisions under a conflict of interest will be recorded by the Secretary and reported in the minutes of the meeting. The report will include:
- the nature and extent of the conflict
- an outline of the discussion
- the actions taken to manage the conflict.
Independent external mediation will be used where conflicts cannot be resolved through the usual procedures.
**Managing contracts**
If you have a conflict of interest, you must not be involved in managing or monitoring a contract in which you have an interest. Monitoring arrangements for such contracts will include provisions for an independent challenge of bills and invoices, and termination of the contract if the relationship if unsatisfactory.

## 3. So you want to become an NED-David Robinson

**So you want to become an NED?**
- Why? Possible reasons:
- to get experience from the other side of the Board table to help you in your day-job Exec role or Consulting business;
- to provide insight into Board responsibilities, governance, processes etc.;
- because you believe in a cause and want to help;
- because you want to switch from being an Exec to having a portfolio career;
- What to know before you start looking:
- Getting your first NED role can be really hard. You need to be persistent and also to be prepared to cope with rejection.
- A minority of private sector roles are advertised. Only the public sector seems able to afford newspaper advertising at present.
- Head-hunters / search consultants exist to find people for jobs; not jobs for candidates. Head-hunters can only long-list candidates who are already on their radar or who they manage to find through their own networking. So, you need to make yourself known to the relevant head-hunters.
- Many head-hunters are fair-weather friends; frequent contact during the recruitment process then radio silence with unsuccessful candidates the minute the assignment is over.
- There is no such thing as a standard recruitment process for NEDs; there are lots of variants. Public sector processes are normally formal; private sector processes can also be formal, but many are still informal and run internally, rather than via a search firm.
- Whatever time commitment is indicated in the Role Profile, you may need to double it for a more realistic assessment of the likely time commitment!
- Director responsibilities must be understood and taken seriously.
- Before you accept a role, do thorough due diligence. If you’re uncomfortable with what you find and don’t get satisfactory answers, don’t  risk taking it on.
- If things blow up, as they can do in any organisation, the time commitment can increase very significantly.
- Start-ups can be great fun but if they fail, as many do, this can have an adverse effect on your reputation and potentially on your employability in your day job, particularly if your day job is with a regulated financial services business.
- NED roles in small organisations (and even in some large ones) may be more akin to part-time Executive roles, where they are expecting hands-on help.

- How to go about it:
- Be very clear what you’re looking for and why. Set out some clear wants / don’t wants i.e. criteria against which to assess opportunities.
- Formulate a written plan, with actions and a timeline, just as you would for any other ‘project’. Refresh it on a regular basis. Half an hour updating the plan every week at the same time (Sunday evening?) and committing to complete one relevant action the following week is good discipline.
- Keep developing and broadening your skills and experience in your day job. Look for opportunities beyond your mainstream responsibilities that will add to your experience and give you something relevant to add to your CV.
- Get onto the radar of head-hunters. If possible get recommendations so that you’re not just going in cold: “Ms. A. B…… suggested I get in touch with you” It’s easier to get past the PA and into see the head-hunter that way.
- Network, network, network! Put together a plan of who in your network might be able to advise you. Be systematic and prioritise who you arrange to meet. At any meeting, ask if they know anyone else who might be able to help, and if you don’t know them already, ask for an introduction.
- Accept / seek out speaking opportunities – a great way of letting people see you in a new light and of building your network.
- Seek out events where you can network.
- The CV:
- Develop a generic CV as a leave behind for head-hunters.
- Keep your CV short; 2 pages ideal, 3 pages max. Focus on achievements i.e. where you personally have made a difference. Include relevant Committee / project / Board experience. Get some independent feedback on your draft CV.
- Include something on your skills, either explicitly or implicitly by reference to what you have achieved: “Led the team that …” etc.
- Minimise the use of jargon. Remember that the reader may know nothing about your industry / organisation so make the CV easy to read without losing accuracy or gravitas.
- Advice varies on whether or not to include personal information i.e. family, external interests etc. Some people include it on the basis that there might just be something there that causes the reader to say: “this candidate sounds really interesting”; others believe it is inappropriate in a CV.
- If applying for a specific role, tailor your generic CV to match what they are looking for, without of course claiming experience / skills you don’t have!

- The Interview
- There is no set format for interviews. They can be structured e.g. with all candidates asked the same questions which are then scored as an aid to deciding who to appoint; they can be one on one; they can be before a panel; they can be informal over coffee / lunch / dinner.
- You will often be asked “do you have any questions for us?” Good preparation ought to enable you to come up with pertinent questions.
- At any interview, shine!
- Don’t expect to hear how you have done straight away. They may have other candidates to interview at later dates, so it can take a few days or occasionally weeks before you hear back.
- What makes a good NED?
- Acts as a ‘critical friend’ of the Executive; gets the balance right between oversight and interference. “Nose in, fingers out”.
- Is diligent; reads the papers long before they get on the bus / taxi / train / plane to go to the meeting.
- Asks questions of the Execs well before the meeting on anything in the papers they don’t understand or where they would like more information. This gives the Execs chance to prepare extra info for the meeting and / or to correct errors for the benefit of everyone attending the meeting. Prior questioning isn’t a hard and fast rule, e.g. if something of concern becomes apparent at the meeting that you hadn’t previously spotted.
- Is conscientious. Missing a meeting has to be an extremely rare event. It’s not like an Exec role where you can miss the occasional Exec meeting because of holidays etc. With an NED role or portfolio of roles, you will be expected to plan your holidays around scheduled Board and Committee meetings.

CtC is a multi-talented group drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds. Our aim is to increase diversity on all types of boards.  We are unique in that we share the responsibility to help each other, volunteering our time and skills in a peer-to-peer support network.  This is your opportunity to help shape the future of the organisation.  For more information on CtC, please see the website:

This is a fantastic opportunity for those looking for their first Board position or looking to develop their non-executive skills. You will be part of a diverse, supportive group responsible for delivering meaningful change in the area of Boardroom diversity. 
**What’s involved?**
The Board will be responsible for all aspects of managing and developing CtC.  The Board will be supported by a Chief Executive Officer (unremunerated) who will also sit on the Board.  Much of the day-to-day work of CtC will be done by sub-committees of the Board (it is anticipated there will be up to 8 Board sub-committees). 
**The nomination process**
Board members for CtC are elected by the members of the organisation. 
All nominations received will be put forward to the membership as candidates. 
Each candidate’s nomination will be supported by a brief manifesto, explaining why they want to be on the Board and what they think they will bring to the role. 
Candidate nominations will be anonymised: members will not see the name for each candidate, but will instead vote for Candidate A, B or C, etc (this is to eliminate unconscious bias as far as possible). 
The exact voting process is still being assessed – more details will be circulated in due course depending on what can be done using SurveyMonkey.
*(*** **Note that the roles of Chair, Secretary and Treasurer will be selected by the Board from its membership once the Board is constituted.)*
**I am interested in standing. What do I do now?**
Please send an e-mail confirming your desire to stand for nomination to Tanya Castell and Sarah Smart by **Monday 5 January 2015**.   ( ;  )
In your e-mail, please explain, in **300 words or less**: 
Why I want to be a CtC Board member (please include in this section if you are prepared to stand as Chair, Secretary or Treasurer)
What I will bring to the CtC Board. 
*(It is up to you how many words you use answering each question, but please use ****no more than 300 words in total for both questions****. If you send more than 300 words, your manifesto will be reduced to 300 words by cutting off everything after **that **limit.)*
If you are keen to be involved, but do not feel you can commit to a Board position at this time, the Board will also be looking for volunteers for the sub-committees in due course. 
If you are unsure whether to stand or not and would like more information, please contact:
Sarah Smart:   /  0780 301 4567

## Chair of the Board of Directors - CDFI Business Loans Ltd

**Chair of the Board of Directors**

**BACKGROUND**

CDFI Business Loans Ltd (CBL) is seeking to recruit a Chair of its Board of Directors.

CBL’s mission is to provide access to finance for underserved Micro, Small and Medium sized Businesses (MSMEs) in the UK to help improve the social and economic outcomes for disadvantaged businesses, people and communities.

CBL’s aim is to create a loan fund of £75m which will be lent (via a team of Delivery Partners) to 2,000 MSMEs in the UK. Lending to disadvantaged MSMEs will have significant social and economic impacts including the creation and saving of 5,200 jobs.

CBL was established by a consortium of seven Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs, now rebranded as Responsible Finance Providers). Responsible Finance Providers lend to MSMEs throughout the UK which are in need of accessible, affordable and equitable finance.  Responsible Finance Providers use traditional banking techniques to assess the viability and risk associated with lending to MSMEs while also take into consideration the social impact of supporting enterprises that other lenders do not.

These seven Responsible Finance Providers will be CBL’s Delivery partners.

CBL will offer loans of between £10,000 and £100,000 to established MSMEs at commercial interest rates for periods up to 5 years.

The CBL consortium has already engaged with banks, equity investors, HMRC and guarantee providers, both in the UK and in Europe, in order to minimise the risk of lending to the MSME market and to maximise returns to the investors.  It is now at a stage where an independent Board of Directors is required to provide strategic oversight of CDFI Business Loans Ltd (The Fund) following its launch (planned for 1 April 2016).

The Fund will be managed by a contract management team, yet to be recuited.

We would expect applicants for the role of Chair to recognise the importance of affordable and accessible finance to MSMEs and have a  basic understanding of tax relief schemes, in this instance Community Investment Tax Relief, first loss guarantees mechanisms and experience of debt finance.

If you would like to discuss any aspects of our bankground ahead of applying for the role, please call Peter Newnham on 01606 882923 or 07711 588007.

## Charity Treasurer Trustee Recruitment

**Families Outside**** is ****looking for a new Treasurer to join its Board of ****Directors**

Families Outside is looking for a new Trustee to join its Board of Directors and contribute to an already diverse, dynamic and passionate team which will take the charity forward as it continues to thrive and develop.  The new Trustee will be appointed Treasurer of the organisation.
**About us:**
Families Outside is the only national charity in Scotland working solely to support the families of people affected by imprisonment.  We work to mitigate the effects of imprisonment on children and families – and consequently to reduce the likelihood of reoffending – through support and information for families and for the people who work with them.
Imprisonment can be a traumatic experience for families, and its impact is often significant and enduring: 
- Risk to housing;
- Financial pressures;
- Problems in caring for children;
- Anxiety, distress and health problems;
- Rejection, stigma, and victimisation by neighbours and the community.

A Scotland wide charity, Families Outside has its head offices based in central Edinburgh though we welcome applications from all over Scotland.  We are funded by a combination of statutory and charitable trust grants, with sufficient income currently in place to allow the charity to carry on its work until at least August 2015.  Further funding raising is always ongoing.
**About the role:**
The Board of Directors is key to the success of Families Outside, providing strategic support and guidance to the Chief Executive and staff team on the ongoing development of the charity.  The Board of Directors are also Trustees of the charity, meaning they are responsible for ensuring it is solvent, well-run and meeting its charitable objectives as outlined in the Constitution.  
The full Board meets four times a year (March, June, September & December) at various office locations in central Edinburgh.  The Finance/HR subgroup, of which the Treasurer is Chair, also meets four times per year, in advance of the full Board meeting.  The role of the subgroup is to support the Board by undertaking governance responsibilities in key areas of financial probity, accountability and adherence to legal and good practice requirements in the HR area, making recommendations to the Board as required.
The Treasurer shall be appointed for a term not exceeding three years and shall be eligible for re-appointment for a second and third term not exceeding three years each.
**About you:**
Ideally the new Treasurer will have expertise in the following areas:
- Finance: accounting and/or book-keeping; financial statements for charities
- Finance: cash management & financial controls; reserves policies
- General: funding sources and requirements
- General: business management

The day to day budgets, management of income and expenditure, bookkeeping and initial audit preparation work are carried out by a highly skilled Executive Officer who is also able to support the Treasurer in preparation of meeting papers and financial reporting.
To apply, please email Jonathan Goodfellow at

**Who we are**

East Park has provided Education and Supported Accommodation services to children and young people with additional support needs, including autism, since 1874.  Our philosophy reflects current legislation, best practice and a commitment to excellence.  All our services focus on the needs of the young people and encourage partnership with the child and family.  

East Park is regularly inspected by the Care Inspectorate, Education Scotland and as an accredited service with the National Autistic Society.  East Park is also an SQA Approved Centre.

East Park has received positive inspection reports from all the above bodies since 2012. All inspection reports are available on the website at  



**What we do**
East Park strives to provide excellent, person centred residential care and 	education to children and young people with complex additional support needs, including Autism Spectrum Disorder, physical and sensory impairments, and challenging behaviour, between the ages of 5 and 25*.  *With the young person at the centre and working with external partners, our work focuses on seeking innovative, personalised approaches which enable each individual to reach his or her maximum potential.

East Park provides four main services:
Education (day & residential)
Supported Accommodation (52 weeks)
A post-school ‘Workmates’ programme for young adults aged 18-25.

**The ****School**

East Park School provides education to children and young people between the ages of 5 and 19, with additional support needs.  All pupils have a significant learning difficulty coupled with additional disabilities including physical disability, sensory impairment, ADHD, Attachment disorder, ASD and challenging behaviour.  Around 80% of the pupils are on the autism spectrum and require specialist techniques and strategies in order to minimise the impact of their barriers to learning.  East Park provides comprehensive and appropriate learning environments and opportunities for this group of children/young people, for example through:


Personal learning plans
Individual and group teaching and learning 
Elaborated curriculum based on Curriculum for           
	Excellence









Sensory curriculum
Post-eighteen education
Links with colleges and other schools
Specialised resources and equipment
Use of community facilities and amenities


Many of the young people are non-verbal communicators, many may require intimate & personal care, the majority have no sense of danger, and all require a high staff ratio to enable them to access fully the curriculum and community.

East Park provides a child-centred curriculum which provides opportunities for the young people to have a range of relevant experiences and achieve positive outcomes.


**Supported Accommodation**

East Park has four high specification purpose-built houses located within pleasant residential areas of the local community.  The houses each accommodate 4 or 5 young people in single occupancy bedrooms.  The location of our houses allows young people to live socially valued and fulfilling lives as part of the community, experiencing neighbourly relationships and having full access to local community activities and resources.  


**Workmates**

“Workmates”, East Park’s supported Education and Supported Employment Service is designed specifically to support young adults with high support needs, aged 17-25.

Workmates offers an individualised service to young adults. High support needs generally would be classed as requiring at least 1:1 support to sustain a meaningful experience in the workplace or college.

The service provides opportunities for:
Continuing and further education
Vocational training
Development of independence
Career development
Supported work experience and employment

Workmates works with each young person as necessary, either directly supporting a placement or in the planning process.  This may increase over time as occupation increases, or may decrease as natural supports are       
                                                                 developed.                        

Each student benefits from a unique package of support appropriate to his/her needs.  Workmates provides opportunities for growth and development to enable individuals to enjoy a fulfilled lifestyle.  The benefits to the young people include:
A wider circle of relationships
Development of natural supports
Different supports from those normally experienced


**The**** Care ****Team**

All our care staff are appropriately qualified and registered.  

Every resident young person has a key worker who acts as a designated link person co-ordinating all aspects of their care.  The key worker supports the young person both on a day to day basis and in relation to the planning and reviewing process, to express their views and choices and to fully participate in all decisions which may affect their lives.

Recognising the importance and benefit of a consistent approach, particularly in relation to supporting young people with autism spectrum disorders, the care team works closely with the education team to develop and implement effective strategies.

In East Park these, specific individualised strategies which support the young person   throughout the day and across settings are incorporated into the following joint processes and procedures:

The young person’s Personal Organiser
Their Behaviour Support Plan
Their Autism Support Plan
Their Personal Learning Plan
Individual Progress and Planning Meetings
Class planning and timetables
Individual activity planners












**East Park**** Philosophy**

**The 24 hour curriculum**

All members of the East Park team recognise that learning opportunities constantly arise from every day experiences and activities and are not restricted to the school day.  Care staff facilitate on-going learning and development by participating in both school projects and themes and in the development and achievement of joint targets agreed at Individual Progress and Planning meetings.  

Reflecting the objectives and values of Curriculum for Excellence and Getting It Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) we aim to support young people to be healthy, achieving, responsible and effective contributors by providing meaningful social and recreational activities which promote the development of life skills and independence.

**Working with others **

We consider genuine effective team work to be at the heart of ensuring best outcomes for young people.  East Park staff work in close partnership with social work staff, health professionals, LD CAMHS teams, etc.  We particularly value our relationship with family members and carers.  Central to all of this is the young person whose input and views are pivotal to all decisions made in relation to his/her life.
**T****ransitions**
All of us experience transitions in our lives and while these can be both exciting and challenging, we recognise that for young people with a learning disability and/or autism, transitions are often overwhelming.

One of the underpinning objectives of the work of the Care Team is to support young people to develop social, emotional and self-care skills, which will help them prepare for life in the adult world.  Taking account of young people’s individual needs and aspirations, our staff promote continual achievement and development, provide young people with positive relationships and positive life experiences, promoting self-determination and feelings of self-worth and striving to improve outcomes for them by supporting them to be all they can be. 

















**East Park ****Professional Development & ****Training**



East Park is fully committed to supporting the learning and development of all colleagues. By providing qualifications and on-going learning and development opportunities to persistently raise the standards of the care and education we provide, we continually refine and affirm the development of a positive ‘Lifelong Learning Culture’ at East Park.

We pride ourselves in being a high quality training resource for the continuous development of our workforce.  East Park supports colleagues to gain a wide range of qualifications from Post Graduate Certificates in Autism Studies to mandatory H&S qualifications. 
As a Scottish Qualifications Authority Approved Centre we deliver the workplace and academic qualifications required by the Care Team to register with the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC).  

We provide a comprehensive programme of induction and continuous training through our blended learning approach, combining on-the-job instruction, in-service training, online courses, external provision and self-directed learning to meet our skills needs.

New employees undertake a programme of formal and informal training which will continue throughout their time with East Park.

Training is provided in a wide range of subjects and our mandatory provision includes Child and Adult Safeguarding, Moving & Handling and Fire Safety.

Our comprehensive approach to training ensures our provision meets, and where possible exceeds, the standards required by our regulatory bodies including the Care Inspectorate, Education Scotland, SSSC and Autism Accreditation.


**E****ast Park’s Training Team**

The training delivery at East Park is organised and managed by the Training Department which is staffed with two professionally qualified and experienced members, as well as design and delivery input provided by highly skilled professionals from across our services.

## Director Advert

Scottish Wresting Association
Independent Highly-Skilled Director


The **Scottish Wrestling Association** is the National Governing Body for Olympic Wrestling and other wrestling-oriented combat sports.  After a better-than-expected Glasgow Commonwealth Games, where Scottish Wrestlers outperformed expectations in capturing 2 Bronze medals, the SWA has seen a complete overhaul of its Board and Governance, and soon will be a limited company.  The new, operational section of the Board are folks familiar with wrestling.  For the remaining appointments, including this one, we are striving to fill with successful businesswomen and men, who can offer several distinct skills, a desire to grow this sport from seed to sequoia, and an enthusiasm and professional, commercial approach that is hard to come by for smaller sports. 

**The Role and Opportunity**.  We have several appointments to fill for Independent Highly-Skilled Directors.  We want folks who will use their contacts and this role to help us commercialize where possible the opportunities to promote Scottish Wrestling, to earn our own revenue and  to liaise with corporations and government for corporate social responsibility programs, grants and funding programs. We currently depend on the generosity of Sport Scotland for funding, a dependency that we would like to lessen and, as a result, consequently strengthen.  

Our goals over the next 4 years are simple and ambitious.  We want to out-perform ourselves, anybody else’s expectations and all the other home nations in the Commonwealth Games 2018.  To do this we must grow this sport in Scotland, and develop Scottish Wrestlers wherever we find them, by getting wrestling into the curriculum at schools and universities, strengthening our current clubs and making new ones and to get kids and adults to take up this sport where **courage, ambition, discipline **and** “****dynamis****”** – the will to win are the hallmarks of a life lived to its utmost.  

**Time Commitment**** and Accountability**. We require as much time as you can spare to do this job.  We cannot pay at this point (nobody on the Board is paid – anything), but we hope within the next year or so that we will first, pay travel expenses, and then - when in a position to do so - pay a modest stipend.  Board meetings will be held for the foreseeable future either in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen (Glasgow will have 2), and once we become a limited company we will have 4 meetings per year including the AGM.  We won’t ask more of you, but we believe you will want to give more as success manifests itself over and over and over again. 

The job spec is as you’d expect, and we can give a short list later if you require, but it is simple: prior significant Board level experience (not necessarily as Company Director however); your expertise in marketing, branding, event management, commercial partnerships and fund raising, creating programs at schools and universities; liaising with funding, commercial and strategic partners, including government; teaching us as we go; being  very commercial; and your own ‘dynamis’.  

Use us as a platform for your next big job, or as a “wind down” or as something cool and different to do.  We just hope you will be around when we go to Australia in 2018.  

Please send us a CV and short sketch of why you would like to do this job by 17 August to Marcin Zdrojewski –  and Cary Depel, Chairman – .

## Visit Scotland Person Specification

**What skills, ****knowledge, ****experience ****and understanding ****do we need new ****VisitScotland B****oard ****M****embers to have?**

It is important that we have people with a variety of different skills, knowledge, experience and understanding which will enable the Board to work effectively.  All Board Members need to have some general skills so they can  make a full contribution to the work of the Board but these do not have to have been gained by working in a management post or at a senior level; you may have a natural aptitude in these areas or you may have gained them through being active in your community, in a voluntary capacity or through your own personal life experience – these are listed in the General Skills and Personal Qualities section below and we have explained exactly what we will be looking for and how they will be tested.

VisitScotland also needs its new members to collectively bring some more specific skills/experience to the Board, to allow it to make a strong, broad and general contribution to the wider visitor economy.  For example, there is a particular need to appoint people who will bring with them more specialist skills around the ‘digital’ agenda and expertise in finance/risk/investment.  These more specific skills are listed in the **Priority Skills/Experience** section and you will need to demonstrate that you possess **at least one** of these skills/experience.  If you believe you can demonstrate more than one, you will be given the opportunity to discuss it further if you are shortlisted for interview..

It is very important that there is the right balance of skills on the board so the Minister will be taking account of which ‘priority’ skill each applicant is able to demonstrate when selecting applicants for appointment.  It is also important that VisitScotland has an appropriate balance of Board members whose experience enables them to consider issues from both an urban and rural perspective so this will be a factor in the decisions which are made at all stages in the appointment process.

## 2. Appointing a NED - Practical Guide

Appointing a Non–Exec Director? Practical Guide
# Why appoint a Non-Exec Director?

Bringing a Non-Executive Director or Chairman into a company can be a very smart move for CEOs, CFOs and for the Board, particularly at times of signiﬁcant change or upheaval in the business. The objectivity and wise experience of the right Non-Exec will be a great asset for businesses of all sizes: from start-ups upwards.
A Non-Exec Director’s experience in the following areas can be invaluable:

industry contacts and knowledge

strategic vision built on his/her past success as a Board Director, for example – assessing new markets or a company acquisition or fund-raising. The recent recession has given directors a lot of invaluable knowledge and experience for dealing with distressed situations as well.

intelligent questioning “Why is the Company doing that?” and gentle challenging of a Board-assumed strategy, to ensure the strategy is right for the business.

sometimes it is a condition of a Private Equity funding round that a speciﬁed Non-Executive Director with industry experience is appointed.

# How do I ﬁnd a Non-Executive Director?
Try:

your personal network

recruitment consultants or a specialist NED appointment company – if you want to pay a fee

professional or industry networking events and online communities e.g.  

Once you have found your NED, the can provide training and ongoing advice for non-executives and also advises companies on how to assist them in fulﬁlling their roles eﬀectively.

Once you have agreed the terms here is the checklist of information you need to agree with the Non- Executive Director to prepare a letter of appointment to be signed by the company and the new Non- Executive Director.

# Before you produce the Non-Exec Director Letter of Appointment
You will need to check the company’s Articles of Association to check the precise method of appointment of new directors which must be followed, e.g. Board Resolution of the current Directors (the default is an Ordinary Resolution).
A copy of the directors’ or members’ decision must be kept at your registered office address, along with the minutes of the board meeting or general meeting at which the resolution was passed.
If the NED will not be voting at Board meetings, then there is no need to do this check or register their details at Companies House, as they will not officially be a NED (see below).
# What terms to include in the letter of appointment.

Decide if the individual is simply to be appointed as a Non-Exec Director or if he/she will also be appointed to the role of chairman.

Set out the appointment start date.

Conﬁrm the length of the initial term so the company can then stop the appointment if it is not working or decide to renew it. A two- or three-year contract with the potential to renew may be a good starting point.
# How can the appointment be terminated by the Company?
Insert protections for the company to stop the appointment if there is breach of company procedures by the Non-Executive Director.
After the initial term insert what period of notice will be required to terminate the appointment from both the Company and the Non-Executive Director.
# What time commitment is fair for a Non-Exec Director?
Agree with the Non-Exec:

How many days a month the non-executive director will be required to work for the company e.g. 1 to 3 days or just a set amount of time each quarter.

How often he/she should attend board meetings – once a month or quarter? Whether he/she will attend strategy days with the Company.
If the Non-Executive will be required to attend any site visits. If the Non-Executive will be required to travel overseas.
# Non-Exec Director’s role, duties & fees
Key questions to ask and agree with the Non-Exec Director are: What are the Non-Executive’s duties?
How much will the Non-Executive be paid a year and when will the fee be reviewed?



# Can the Non-Exec Director have outside interests?
It is important to ﬁnd out what are the Non-Exec Directors outside interests so that the company knows what these other interests are and ensure there are no conﬂicts. Every Board Director who votes at Board (of Director) Meetings has a duty to disclose conﬂicts of interests.
It is good practice to ask the Non-Exec Director to write down what these interests are and to notify the company if any changes are made.
# Insurance – what is Directors & Oﬃcers Insurance?
Non- Executive Directors will always want to know this insurance is in place to protect them in case they are sued personally whilst acting lawfully in their role for the company.
The company is permitted in Company Law and in its Articles of Association to have this insurance.

# What to do after the letter of appointment is signed?

Provide a welcome pack for the Non-Executive Director.

Attend to the usual administration for a new company joiner, e.g. e-mail address & update the website to show the company has now got this experienced person on Board. Notify the company insurers.

Within 14 days of the appointment, register the Non-Exec Director’s appointment details at Companies House if he/she is going to have the right to vote at Board meetings. If they do not have a right to vote, they are not a NED/ Board of Director Member – rather they would be an Advisor or Board Observer and therefore do not need to be registered on Companies House. To do this, ﬁle the on the . Companies House is the UK Government registry where all company and director details must be ﬁled – please note there are late-ﬁling penalties!

Update the company’s Register of Directors contained in the Statutory Books also called Company
Registers.
