| Any change to a company’s articles requires a 75% majority. A supermajority clause can be applied to the social mission lock, requiring a higher majority of shareholders for it to be amended or removed, e.g. 90% or even 100%. | A third party, usually a charity or other social mission organisation, holds a golden share. This means their consent is required to change specified provisions in a venture’s governing documents. | Like a golden share, but with the additional effect that the share can be returned to the venture usually after a period of time or particular event. The specific terms are stated in a venture’s governing documents |
