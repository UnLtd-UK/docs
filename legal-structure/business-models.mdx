Summary
List here 6 key facts in a short paragraph about you and your venture:
- What is your primary aim linked to the overall social impact you achieve.
- What market do you operate in?
- Who are your key customers (we work with ????)
- Who is your team and what is their experience?
- Some facts about past revenue
- What are your plans to scale?




A few more key facts about this document – make it your own, insert pictures, colours, make it read your story and make it reflect your brand.



Social Value Proposition

Repeat point 1 here from page 1

What do you do that is different that makes you unique that people should buy from you? 
This is where you talk through your theory of change. How your activities link to the outcomes that your interactions make. Positive news stories client testimonials. This is saying you can trust us to deliver impact we know what we are doing.

You could insert your whole TOC and then talk about what you do and give some figures on the change that has happened so far.

Example: 
**Educational workshops:** We have delivered workshops in partnership with??? To ??? people who have experienced long term unemployment. From these workshops 34% of people successfully went onto further education and training and 18% went directly into work. Give full information about what you think your future client should know about what you sell/ deliver.
John who participated in the workshop said this “???”

Also add here any learning from feedback.


Market
Repeat 2 from page 1

This is where you prove to us that you know the market that you operate in.
- Size of market – tell us about what you know in sector that you work in.
- Competitors – who are they, what do they do and how much do they charge? Use a table to display who they are, what they sell, and their cost structure compared to yours, why are they different?




- Insert comment from no 3 on page 1
- Customers – break it down for each of your trading areas:
- Workshops?
- Events?
- Wholesale
- Etc..
- Marketing  - again break it down for each of your trading areas, really brainstorm who your customer groups are and how their socio economic group/ sector would find out about you.
- How do you plan to increase sales what key areas are you looking at to expand? Again split down into trading activities and link to marketing.






The Team
 Insert no 4 from page 1

What is your USP?

Give a short bio of each of your key operations team, what are their roles in the organisation. Can we trust you? Do you have the right people in the right roles?

Provide photographs, drawings, whatever best represents each of you. 

Partnerships:
Who do you work in partnership with and what do they say about you (quotes or testimonials)?
How does the partnership work? Who leads the partnership? Include logos and contact details to verify partnership.
Customers:
Who are your current customers and what do they say about you?







Finances

Insert point 5 from page 1

- Revenue achieved so far and where it has come from. If contracts give details i.e. 3 year SLA contract paid on outcomes etc.. GP% made etc…
- Funds generated – any grants achieved, when, who, how long?
- What finance do you need to scale and what will you spend it on (breakdown of spend)?
- Risks and contingencies – again you could insert a brief strategy here.






















- Sales Strategy

- Insert no 6 from page 1 here.

- Tell us about the plan – again split down into trading areas and keep it simple:
- i.e. Having secured the credibility with these partners we have now identified that we can approach??
- New routes to market
- Focus on 3 to 5 key areas of growth and use outputs and financial growth as targets.
- Insert breakdown of financial targets in terms of sales and ??? (again a simple diagram, a more detailed forecast can be given upon request)
- Tell us about the increases in social impact that will happen as a result of you scaling your activities.













- End with a nice story:

- It is always good to finish reading with something that will inspire you, a real change story.

## Mission-Led Business Advice for TrainerRoad

Hi Nate,
Thanks for getting back to me.  Really pleased that you said yes and I can share some of my thinking with you – even if it turns out to be irrelevant – as I think cycling and TrainerRoad has some great potential in being a mission-led business or social enterprise.
Just to explain something real quick before I dive into some potential business models or initiatives you could start and ways of embedding this social purpose into the heart of what you do I thought it worth mentioning I’ll interchange between a lot of terms “social business”, “mission-led”, “social enterprise” etc etc but they are all much of a muchness.  One useful way of explaining what I’m talking about is with this continuum:

It’s basically saying that you don’t have to put yourself solidly in one camp and say “we are a business so only try to make a profit” but actually shows there’s a potential to incorporate more social purpose into your business activities.  (NB: some of these terms are a little Britain-centric so don’t worry about the detail too much) 
I’m obviously not completely versed on where TrainerRoad is on this spectrum above or where it is with it’s thinking of how it could do more as a company but I’m going to assume you are in the “traditional business category”.  With that in mind I’ve made a few bullet points of the type of work you could incorporate into TrainerRoad that could help incorporate some of your social aspirations. 
**Potential ****“****Social Business****”**** Models:**
- 1-for-1 model: For one item purchased, an item (or it’s equivalent value) is donated to a particular cause.  For instance, every time you get a subscriber you donate a months’ worth of subscription to a cause.  Some examples of businesses operating in this way:
- Tom’s Shoes (book by the founder), Bomba’s (even do cycling socks), melon optics glasses company.
- Revenue % donation: this is explained really well in the example but it’s essentially committing to some sort of charitable giving through your pre-tax profit (based on the assumption that the donation won’t be taxed and it won’t cost you that much money to donate it as you would have lost some of it in tax anyway)
- 1% for the planet
- Specific products with a specific cause: I’ll explain this one with a suggestion…you could great an additional product-line or subscription offer that creates some sort of social value.  So you could, for instance, replicate your existing offer, add on a few extra $’s to the product’s cost and say “the additional cost of this subscription fee will go towards TrainerRoads social objects of X, Y and Z” and you could decide to match the donation or something as well if you wanted.
- VisionSpring, Patagonia (Sure there are some better examples but both companies are creating social or environmental value with each product sale)
- Training, sponsoring and employing staff from disadvantaged backgrounds: this could take SO many different forms but you have the opportunity to do some really unique things here.  For instance, everything from proactive recruitment or internships, all the way to thinking about how you could use initiatives (like the ones mentioned in the first three models) to support the next generation of cyclists/triatheletes.  Again, to lead with an example, you could potentially offer a higher priced package or ask people if they’d want to “donate/sponsor” a rider for an additional bit of money and in return you’ll provide your product for free to people that wouldn’t normally have access to such a high quality training tool due to their background, lack of role models etc.
- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR Scheme) or Philanthropic Giving: these are more google-able terms so if you want to find out more I’d suggest having a look around!
- Trek Bikes CSR or specific schemes like One Tree Planted – Morvelo (UK cycling clothing company) use this scheme.
- Starting up a charity or foundation (or team that has specific social objectives?) which is supported by TrainerRoad/the industry
**Ways of embedding this:**
- Become a B-Corp “Certified B Corporations are a new kind of business that balances purpose and profit. They are legally required to consider the impact of their decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. This is a community of leaders, driving a global movement of people using business as a force for good.”
- Another option is to amend your “Articles of Association” (not sure what the US term is) and include a responsibility for your organisation to conduct itself in a centre manner.  This will already be standard practice for things like voting rights etc so why not include a social mission or objective in them to state what you want to achieve alongside generating profit.
- Highly publicised social commitment either through branding or adopting something like a CSR.
Hope those options are of some help and provide food for thought.  If they’ve provided some sort of stimulation or useful challenge then I’d consider that a job well done (even if you put it in the “not for right now” category) 
Anyway, this email is plenty long enough and I’ve got an early ride in the morning (first time in a small group since early-March!) 
Let me know if you want to discuss anything in particular further and all the best
Tim

## Theory of Change Explainer

**Theory of Change Explainer – Simplified**
**Overview**
A theory of change is like a roadmap for a social venture that aims to make a positive impact. It explains how you plan to go from your starting point to your desired goal. Imagine you are planning a trip: you decide where you want to go (your goal), the steps you need to take to get there (your activities), and what you hope to see along the way (your results).
**Here are the key parts of a theory of change:**
**1. Inputs**
These are the resources you need to start your journey. Think of inputs as the fuel for your trip. Inputs can include things like:
- Money (funding or budget)
- People (staff, volunteers)
- Materials and tools (computers, books, supplies)
- Time (hours needed to complete tasks)
**2. Outputs**
Outputs are the immediate results of your activities, like the things you produce or deliver. They are often easy to measure. If you’re on a trip, outputs might be the miles you travel each day or the photos you take. Examples of outputs are:
- Number of workshops held
- Number of people trained
- Amount of food distributed
- Reports or publications produced
**3. Outcomes**
Outcomes are the changes or benefits that happen because of your outputs. They are the positive effects you see as a result of your work. On your trip, outcomes might be reaching your destination, making new friends, or learning something new. Outcomes can be short-term or long-term:
- Short-term outcomes: Immediate changes, like participants gaining new skills after a workshop.
- Long-term outcomes (impact): Lasting impact, like increased job opportunities for participants because of their new skills.
**Putting It All Together**
Here’s a simple example:
- Goal: Improve literacy rates in a community.
- Inputs: Books, trained teachers, funding for educational programs.
- Activities: Hold reading classes and distribute books.
- Outputs: Number of reading classes held, number of books given out.
- Outcomes: Increased reading skills among children (short-term), higher literacy rates in the community (long-term).

A theory of change helps everyone involved understand how their efforts contribute to the overall goal and what they need to achieve at each step. It’s a clear plan that shows how change will happen and what you need to make it happen.
